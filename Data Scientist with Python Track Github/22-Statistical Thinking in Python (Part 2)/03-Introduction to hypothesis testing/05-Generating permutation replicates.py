Generating permutation replicates

As discussed in the video, a permutation replicate is a single value of a statistic computed from a
permutation sample. As the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2 is useful for you to generate
bootstrap replicates, it is useful to have a similar function, draw_perm_reps(), to generate permutation replicates.
You will write this useful function in this exercise.

The function has call signature draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1). Importantly, func must be a
function that takes two arrays as arguments. In most circumstances, func will be a function you write yourself.

    1   Define a function with this signature: draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1).
            -Initialize an array to hold the permutation replicates using np.empty().
            -Write a for loop to:
                -Compute a permutation sample using your permutation_sample() function
                -Pass the samples into func() to compute the replicate and store the result in your array of replicates.
            -Return the array of replicates.
