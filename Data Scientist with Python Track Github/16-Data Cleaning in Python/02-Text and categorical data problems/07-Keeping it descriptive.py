Keeping it descriptive

To further understand travelers' experiences in the San Francisco Airport, the quality assurance department
sent out a qualitative questionnaire to all travelers who gave the airport the worst score on all possible categories.
The objective behind this questionnaire is to identify common patterns in what travelers are saying about the airport.

Their response is stored in the survey_response column. Upon a closer look, you realized a few of the answers gave
the shortest possible character amount without much substance. In this exercise, you will isolate the responses with
a character count higher than 40 , and make sure your new DataFrame contains responses with 40 characters or more using
an assert statement.

The airlines DataFrame is in your environment, and pandas is imported as pd.

    Using the airlines DataFrame, store the length of each instance in the survey_response column in resp_length
    by using .str.len().
    Isolate the rows of airlines with resp_length higher than 40.
    Assert that the smallest survey response length in airlines_survey is now bigger than 40.

# Store length of each row in survey_response column
resp_length = airlines['survey_response'].str.len()

# Find rows in airlines where resp_length > 40
airlines_survey = airlines[resp_length > 40]

# Assert minimum survey_response length is > 40
assert airlines_survey['survey_response'].str.len().min() > 40

# Print new survey_response column
print(airlines_survey['survey_response'])
