Follow the money

In this exercise, you're working with another version of the banking DataFrame that contains missing
values for both the cust_id column and the acct_amount column.

You want to produce analysis on how many unique customers the bank has, the average amount held by customers and more.
You know that rows with missing cust_id don't really help you, and that on average acct_amount is usually 5 times the
amount of inv_amount.

In this exercise, you will drop rows of banking with missing cust_ids, and impute missing values of acct_amount with
some domain knowledge.

    Use .dropna() to drop missing values of the cust_id column in banking and store the results in banking_fullid.
    Compute the estimated acct_amount of banking_fullid knowing that acct_amount is usually inv_amount * 5 and assign
    the results to acct_imp.
    Impute the missing values of acct_amount in banking_fullid with the newly created acct_imp using .fillna().

# Drop missing values of cust_id
banking_fullid = banking.dropna(subset = ['cust_id'])

# Compute estimated acct_amount
acct_imp = banking_fullid['inv_amount'] * 5

# Impute missing acct_amount with corresponding acct_imp
banking_imputed = banking_fullid.fillna({'acct_amount':acct_imp})

# Print number of missing values
print(banking_imputed.isna().sum())
