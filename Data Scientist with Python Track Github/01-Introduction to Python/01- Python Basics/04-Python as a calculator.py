Python as a calculator

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,
there is also support for more advanced operations such as:

    Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right.
    For example 4**2 will give 16.
    Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right.
    For example 18 % 7 equals 4.

The code in the script on the right gives some examples.
Instructions
100 XP

Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's 100×1.1=110
dollars, and after two years it's 100×1.1×1.1=121. Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years,
and print the result.

# Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100 * 1.1**7)
