FIFA 18: exploring defenders

In the FIFA 18 dataset, various attributes of players are present. Two such attributes are:

    sliding tackle: a number between 0-99 which signifies how accurate a player is able to perform sliding tackles
    aggression: a number between 0-99 which signifies the commitment and will of a player

These are typically high in defense-minded players. In this exercise, you will perform clustering based on these
attributes in the data.

This data consists of 5000 rows, and is considerably larger than earlier datasets. Running hierarchical clustering
on this data can take up to 10 seconds.

The following modules are pre-loaded: dendrogram, linkage, fcluster from scipy.cluster.hierarchy, matplotlib.pyplot as plt,
seaborn as sns. The data is stored in a Pandas dataframe, fifa.

Instructions


    1   Fit the scaled data in columns scaled_sliding_tackle and scaled_aggression into a hierarchical clustering algorithm.
        Additionally, you may want to check how long it takes to run the data in the console using the timeit module.   - 25 XP

    2   Assign cluster labels to each row in the data using the fcluster() function (use 3 clusters).   - 25 XP

    3   Display cluster centers of each cluster with respect to the scaled columns by calculating the
        mean value for each cluster.    - 25 XP

    4   Create a scatter plot using seaborn with the scaled_sliding_tackle attribute on the x-axis and the
        scaled_aggression attribute on the y-axis. Assign a different color to each cluster.    - 25 XP

# Fit the data into a hierarchical clustering algorithm
distance_matrix = linkage(fifa[['scaled_sliding_tackle', 'scaled_aggression']], 'ward')

# Assign cluster labels to each row of data
fifa['cluster_labels'] = fcluster(distance_matrix, 3, criterion='maxclust')

# Display cluster centers of each cluster
print(fifa[['scaled_sliding_tackle', 'scaled_aggression', 'cluster_labels']].groupby('cluster_labels').mean())
