Timing run of hierarchical clustering

In earlier exercises of this chapter, you have used the data of Comic-Con footfall to create clusters.
In this exercise you will time how long it takes to run the algorithm on DataCamp's system.

Remember that you can time the execution of small code snippets with:

%timeit sum([1, 3, 2])

The data is stored in a Pandas data frame, comic_con. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the
standardized X and Y coordinates of people at a given point in time. The timeit module and linkage function are already imported

How long does it take to the run the linkage function on the comic con data?
