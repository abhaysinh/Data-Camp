How many dominant colors?

We have loaded the following image using the imread() function of the image class of matplotlib.

The RGB values are stored in a data frame, batman_df. The RGB values have been standardized used the whiten() function,
stored in columns, scaled_red, scaled_blue and scaled_green.

Construct an elbow plot with the data frame. How many dominant colors are present?

    1   Create a list of distortions based on each value in num_clusters by running the kmeans() function.

    2   Create a data frame elbow_plot with the lists: num_clusters and distortions.

    3   Plot the data with seaborn's .lineplot() method with num_clusters on the x-axis and distortions on the y-axis.

distortions = []
num_clusters = range(1, 7)

# Create a list of distortions from the kmeans function
for i in num_clusters:
    cluster_centers, distortion = kmeans(batman_df[['scaled_red', 'scaled_blue', 'scaled_green']], i)
    distortions.append(distortion)

# Create a data frame with two lists, num_clusters and distortions
elbow_plot = pd.DataFrame({'num_clusters': num_clusters, 'distortions': distortions})

# Create a line plot of num_clusters and distortions
sns.lineplot(x='num_clusters', y='distortions', data = elbow_plot)
plt.xticks(num_clusters)
plt.show()
