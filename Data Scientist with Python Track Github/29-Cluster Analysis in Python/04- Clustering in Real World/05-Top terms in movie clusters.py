Top terms in movie clusters

Now that you have created a sparse matrix, generate cluster centers and print the top three terms in each cluster.
Use the .todense() method to convert the sparse matrix, tfidf_matrix to a normal matrix for the kmeans() function to
process. Then, use the .get_feature_names() method to get a list of terms in the tfidf_vectorizer object.
The zip() function in Python joins two lists.

The tfidf_vectorizer object and sparse matrix, tfidf_matrix, from the previous have been retained in this exercise.
kmeans has been imported from SciPy.

With a higher number of data points, the clusters formed would be defined more clearly. However,
this requires some computational power, making it difficult to accomplish in an exercise here.
