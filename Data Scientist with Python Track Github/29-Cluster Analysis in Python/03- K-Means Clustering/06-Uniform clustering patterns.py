Uniform clustering patterns

Now that you are familiar with the impact of seeds, let us look at the bias in k-means clustering towards
the formation of uniform clusters.

Let us use a mouse-like dataset for our next exercise. A mouse-like dataset is a group of points that resemble
he head of a mouse: it has three clusters of points arranged in circles, one each for the face and two ears of a mouse.

Here is how a typical mouse-like dataset looks like (Source).

The data is stored in a Pandas data frame, mouse. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the
standardized X and Y coordinates of the data points.

Instructions

    1   Import kmeans and vq functions in SciPy.

    2   Generate cluster centers using the kmeans() function with three clusters.

    3   Create cluster labels with vq() with the cluster centers generated above.

# Import the kmeans and vq functions
from scipy.cluster.vq import kmeans, vq

# Generate cluster centers
cluster_centers, distortion = kmeans(mouse[['x_scaled', 'y_scaled']], 3)

# Assign cluster labels
mouse['cluster_labels'], distortion_list = vq(mouse[['x_scaled', 'y_scaled']], cluster_centers)

# Plot clusters
sns.scatterplot(x='x_scaled', y='y_scaled',
                hue='cluster_labels', data = mouse)
plt.show()
