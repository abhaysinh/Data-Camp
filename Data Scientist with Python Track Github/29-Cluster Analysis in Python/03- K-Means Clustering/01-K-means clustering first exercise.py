K-means clustering: first exercise

This exercise will familiarize you with the usage of k-means clustering on a dataset.
Let us use the Comic Con dataset and check how k-means clustering works on it.

Recall the two steps of k-means clustering:

    Define cluster centers through kmeans() function. It has two required arguments: observations and number of clusters.
    Assign cluster labels through the vq() function. It has two required arguments: observations and cluster centers.

The data is stored in a Pandas data frame, comic_con. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the
standardized X and Y coordinates of people at a given point in time.

Instructions
100 XP

    1   Import kmeans and vq functions in SciPy.

    2   Generate cluster centers using the kmeans() function with two clusters.

    3   Create cluster labels using these cluster centers.

# Import the kmeans and vq functions
from scipy.cluster.vq import kmeans, vq

# Generate cluster centers
cluster_centers, distortion = kmeans(comic_con[['x_scaled', 'y_scaled']], 2)

# Assign cluster labels
comic_con['cluster_labels'], distortion_list = vq(comic_con[['x_scaled', 'y_scaled']], cluster_centers)

# Plot clusters
sns.scatterplot(x='x_scaled', y='y_scaled',
                hue='cluster_labels', data = comic_con)
plt.show()
