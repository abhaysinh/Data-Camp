Elbow method on uniform data

In the earlier exercise, you constructed an elbow plot on data with well-defined clusters.
Let us now see how the elbow plot looks on a data set with uniformly distributed points.
You may want to display the data points on the console before proceeding with the exercise.

The data is stored in a Pandas data frame, uniform_data. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the
standardized X and Y coordinates of points.

Instructions


    1   Create a list of distortions for each cluster in num_clusters.      - 50 XP
        Create a data frame elbow_plot with num_clusters and distortions.
        With the .lineplot() method, plot elbow_plot with num_clusters in the x axis and distortions in the y axis.

    2   Question    - 50 XP

        From the elbow plot, how many clusters are there in the data?

        Possible Answers

        Can not be determined
        3 clusters
        4 clusters

Answer : Can not be determined
'''


distortions = []
num_clusters = range(2, 7)

# Create a list of distortions from the kmeans function
for i in num_clusters:
    cluster_centers, distortion = kmeans(uniform_data[['x_scaled', 'y_scaled']], i)
    distortions.append(distortion)

# Create a data frame with two lists - number of clusters and distortions
elbow_plot = pd.DataFrame({'num_clusters': num_clusters, 'distortions': distortions})

# Creat a line plot of num_clusters and distortions
sns.lineplot(x='num_clusters', y='distortions', data=elbow_plot)
plt.xticks(num_clusters)
plt.show()
