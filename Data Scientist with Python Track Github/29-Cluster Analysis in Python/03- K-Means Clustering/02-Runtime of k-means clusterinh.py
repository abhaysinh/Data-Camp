Runtime of k-means clustering

Recall that it took a significantly long time to run hierarchical clustering. How long does it take to run
the kmeans() function on the FIFA dataset?

The data is stored in a Pandas data frame, fifa. scaled_sliding_tackle and scaled_aggression are the relevant
scaled columns. timeit and kmeans have been imported.

Cluster centers are defined through the kmeans() function. It has two required arguments: observations and
 number of clusters. You can use %timeit before a piece of code to check how long it takes to run.
 You can time the kmeans() function for three clusters on the fifa dataset.
