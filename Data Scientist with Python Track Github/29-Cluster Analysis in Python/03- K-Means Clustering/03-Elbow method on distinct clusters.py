Elbow method on distinct clusters

Let us use the comic con data set to see how the elbow plot looks on a data set with distinct, well-defined clusters.
You may want to display the data points before proceeding with the exercise.

The data is stored in a Pandas data frame, comic_con. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the
standardized X and Y coordinates of people at a given point in time.

Instructions


    1    Create a list of distortions for each cluster in num_clusters.     - 50 XP
        Create a data frame elbow_plot with num_clusters and distortions.
        With the .lineplot() method, plot elbow_plot with num_clusters in the x axis and distortions in the y axis.

    2   Question        - 50 XP

        From the elbow plot, how many clusters are there in the data?

        Possible Answers

        2 clusters
        4 clusters
        6 clusters

    Answer :  2 clusters

'''


distortions = []
num_clusters = range(1, 7)

# Create a list of distortions from the kmeans function
for i in num_clusters:
    cluster_centers, distortion = kmeans(comic_con[['x_scaled', 'y_scaled']], i)
    distortions.append(distortion)

# Create a data frame with two lists - num_clusters, distortions
elbow_plot = pd.DataFrame({'num_clusters': num_clusters, 'distortions': distortions})

# Creat a line plot of num_clusters and distortions
sns.lineplot(x='num_clusters', y='distortions', data = elbow_plot)
plt.xticks(num_clusters)
plt.show()
