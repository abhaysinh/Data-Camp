FIFA 18: defenders revisited

In the FIFA 18 dataset, various attributes of players are present. Two such attributes are:

    defending: a number which signifies the defending attributes of a player
    physical: a number which signifies the physical attributes of a player

These are typically defense-minded players. In this exercise, you will perform clustering based on these attributes in the data.

The following modules have been pre-loaded: kmeans, vq from scipy.cluster.vq, matplotlib.pyplot as plt,
seaborn as sns. The data for this exercise is stored in a Pandas dataframe, fifa. The scaled variables are scaled_def
and scaled_phy.


Instructions


    1   Initialize the random seed to the list [1000,2000]. -25 XP

    2   Fit the scaled data in columns scaled_def and scaled_phy into a k-means clustering algorithm with
        3 clusters and assign cluster labels.- 25 XP

    3   Display cluster centers of each cluster with respect to the scaled columns by calculating
        the mean value for each cluster.    - 25 XP

    4   Create a seaborn scatter plot with scaled_def on the x-axis and scaled_phy on the y-axis,
        with each cluster represented by a different color.- 25 XP
