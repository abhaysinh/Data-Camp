Normalization of small numbers

In earlier examples, you have normalization of whole numbers. In this exercise, you will look at the treatment
of fractional numbers - the change of interest rates in the country of Bangalla over the years. For your use,
matplotlib.pyplot is imported as plt.

Instructions

    1   Scale the list rate_cuts, which contains the changes in interest rates.

    2   Plot the original data against the scaled data.

# Prepare data
rate_cuts = [0.0025, 0.001, -0.0005, -0.001, -0.0005, 0.0025, -0.001, -0.0015, -0.001, 0.0005]

# Use the whiten() function to standardize the data
scaled_data = whiten(rate_cuts)

# Plot original data
plt.plot(rate_cuts, label='original')

# Plot scaled data
plt.plot(scaled_data, label='scaled')

plt.legend()
plt.show()
