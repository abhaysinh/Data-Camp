How many joyrides?

Suppose you have a theory that some people take long bike rides before putting their bike back in the same dock.
Let's call these rides "joyrides".

You only have data on one bike, so while you can't draw any bigger conclusions, it's certainly worth a look.

Are there many joyrides? How long were they in our data set? Use the median instead of the mean, because we
know there are some very long trips in our data set that might skew the answer, and the median is less sensitive to outliers.

    Create a Pandas Series which is True when Start station and End station are the same, and assign the result to joyrides.
    Calculate the median duration of all rides.
    Calculate the median duration of joyrides.

# Create joyrides
joyrides = (rides['Start station'] == rides['End station'])

# Total number of joyrides
print("{} rides were joyrides".format(joyrides.sum()))

# Median of all rides
print("The median duration overall was {:.2f} seconds"\
      .format(rides['Duration'].median()))

# Median of joyrides
print("The median duration for joyrides was {:.2f} seconds"\
      .format(rides[joyrides]['Duration'].median()))
