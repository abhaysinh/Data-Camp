    Subtract the Start date column from the End date column to get a Series of timedeltas; assign the result to ride_durations.
    Convert ride_durations into seconds and assign the result to the 'Duration' column of rides.

# Subtract the start date from the end date
ride_durations = rides['End date'] - rides['Start date']

# Convert the results to seconds
rides['Duration'] = ride_durations.dt.total_seconds()

print(rides['Duration'].head())
