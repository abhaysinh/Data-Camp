Counting events per calendar month

Hurricanes can make landfall in Florida throughout the year. As we've already discussed, some months are more
hurricane-prone than others.

Using florida_hurricane_dates, let's see how hurricanes in Florida were distributed across months throughout the year.

We've created a dictionary called hurricanes_each_month to hold your counts and set the initial counts to zero.
You will loop over the list of hurricanes, incrementing the correct month in hurricanes_each_month as you go, and
then print the result.

    Within the for loop:
    Assign month to be the month of that hurricane.
    Increment hurricanes_each_month for the relevant month by 1.

                         7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0, 12: 0}

# Loop over all hurricanes
for hurricane in florida_hurricane_dates:
    # Pull out the month
    month = hurricane.month
    # Increment the count in your dictionary by one
