Subtracting dates

Python date objects let us treat calendar dates as something similar to numbers: we can compare
them, sort them, add, and even subtract them. This lets us do math with dates in a way that would be a pain to do by hand.

The 2007 Florida hurricane season was one of the busiest on record, with 8 hurricanes in one year. The first one
hit on May 9th, 2007, and the last one hit on December 13th, 2007. How many days elapsed between the first and last
hurricane in 2007?
