'''
Counting events before and after noon

In this chapter, you will be working with a list of all bike trips for one Capital Bikeshare bike, W20529,
from October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. This list has been loaded as onebike_datetimes.

Each element of the list is a dictionary with two entries: start is a datetime object corresponding to the start
of a trip (when a bike is removed from the dock) and end is a datetime object corresponding to the end of a trip
(when a bike is put back into a dock).

You can use this data set to understand better how this bike was used. Did more trips start before noon or after noon?

    Within the for loop, complete the if statement to check if the trip started before noon.
    Within the for loop, increment trip_counts['AM'] if the trip started before noon, and trip_counts['PM'] if it
    started after noon.

# Create dictionary to hold results
trip_counts = {'AM': 0, 'PM': 0}

# Loop over all trips
for trip in onebike_datetimes:
    # Check to see if the trip starts before noon
    if trip['start'].hour < 12:
        # Increment the counter for before noon
        trip_counts['AM'] += 1
    else:
        # Increment the counter for after noon
        trip_counts['PM'] += 1
