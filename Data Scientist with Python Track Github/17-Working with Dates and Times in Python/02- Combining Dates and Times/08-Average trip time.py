Average trip time

W20529 took 291 trips in our data set. How long were the trips on average? We can use the built-in Python
functions sum() and len() to make this calculation.

Based on your last coding exercise, the data has been loaded as onebike_durations. Each entry is a number of seconds
that the bike was out of the dock.

    Calculate total_elapsed_time across all trips in onebike_durations.
    Calculate number_of_trips for onebike_durations.
    Divide total_elapsed_time by number_of_trips to get the average trip length.

# What was the total duration of all trips?
total_elapsed_time = sum(onebike_durations)

# What was the total number of trips?
number_of_trips = len(onebike_durations)

# Divide the total duration by the number of trips
print(total_elapsed_time / number_of_trips)
