'''
What time did the bike leave? (Global edition)

When you need to move a datetime from one timezone into another, use .astimezone() and tz.
Often you will be moving things into UTC, but for fun let's try moving things from 'America/New_York' into a
few different time zones.

Instructions

    1   Set uk to be the timezone for the UK: 'Europe/London'.  - 35 XP
        Change local to be in the uk timezone and assign it to notlocal.

    2   Set ist to be the timezone for India: 'Asia/Kolkata'.  - 35 XP
        Change local to be in the ist timezone and assign it to notlocal.

    3   Set sm to be the timezone for Samoa: 'Pacific/Apia'.  - 30 XP
        Change local to be in the sm timezone and assign it to notlocal.

# Pull out the start of the first trip
local = onebike_datetimes[0]['start']

# What time was it in the UK?

# Print them out and see the difference
print(local.isoformat())
print(notlocal.isoformat())
