    Create edt, a timezone object whose UTC offset is -4 hours.
    Within the for loop:
    Set the tzinfo for trip['start'].
    Set the tzinfo for trip['end'].

# Create a timezone object corresponding to UTC-4
edt = timezone(timedelta(hours=-4))

# Loop over trips, updating the start and end datetimes to be in UTC-4
for trip in onebike_datetimes[:10]:
  # Update trip['start'] and trip['end']
  trip['start'] = trip['start'].replace(tzinfo = edt)
  trip['end'] = trip['end'].replace(tzinfo = edt)
