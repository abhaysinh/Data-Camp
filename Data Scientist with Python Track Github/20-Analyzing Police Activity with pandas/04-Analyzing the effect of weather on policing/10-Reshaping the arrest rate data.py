Reshaping the arrest rate data

In this exercise, you'll start by reshaping the arrest_rate Series into a DataFrame.
This is a useful step when working with any multi-indexed Series, since it enables you to access the
full range of DataFrame methods.

Then, you'll create the exact same DataFrame using a pivot table. This is a great example of how pandas
often gives you more than one way to reach the same result!

    Unstack the arrest_rate Series to reshape it into a DataFrame.
    Create the exact same DataFrame using a pivot table! Each of the three .pivot_table() parameters should
    be specified as one of the ri_weather columns.

# Unstack the 'arrest_rate' Series into a DataFrame
print(arrest_rate.unstack())

# Create the same DataFrame using a pivot table
print(ri_weather.pivot_table(index='violation', columns='rating', values='is_arrested'))
