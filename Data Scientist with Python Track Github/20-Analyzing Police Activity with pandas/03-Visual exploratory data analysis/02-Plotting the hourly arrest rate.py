Plotting the hourly arrest rate

In this exercise, you'll create a line plot from the hourly_arrest_rate object.
A line plot is appropriate in this case because you're showing how a quantity changes over time.

This plot should help you to spot some trends that may not have been obvious when examining the raw numbers!
