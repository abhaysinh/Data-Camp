Binning data

When the data on the x axis is a continuous value, it can be useful to break it into different bins in
order to get a better visualization of the changes in the data.

For this exercise, we will look at the relationship between tuition and the Undergraduate population abbreviated
as UG in this data. We will start by looking at a scatter plot of the data and examining the impact of different bin
sizes on the visualization.

Instructions

    1 Create a regplot of Tuition and UG and set the fit_reg parameter to False to disable the regression line. - 30 XP

    2 Create another plot with the UG data divided into 5 bins. - 30 XP

    3 Create a regplot() with the data divided into 8 bins. - 40 XP
