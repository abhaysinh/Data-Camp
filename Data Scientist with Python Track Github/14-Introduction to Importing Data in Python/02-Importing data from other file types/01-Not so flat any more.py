In Chapter 1, you learned how to use the IPython magic command ! ls to explore your current working directory.
You can also do this natively in Python using the library os, which consists of miscellaneous operating system interfaces.

The first line of the following code imports the library os, the second line stores the name of the current
directory in a string called wd and the third outputs the contents of the directory in a list to the shell.

import os
wd = os.getcwd()
os.listdir(wd)

Run this code in the IPython shell and answer the following questions. Ignore the files that begin with ..

Check out the contents of your current directory and answer the following questions: (1) which file is in
your directory and NOT an example of a flat file; (2) why is it not a flat file?
