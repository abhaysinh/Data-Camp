Pivot temperature by city and year

It's interesting to see how temperatures for each city change over time. Looking at every month results in a big table, which can be tricky to reason about. Instead, let's look at how temperatures change by year.

You can access the components of a date (year, month and day) using code of the form dataframe["column"].dt.component. For example, the month component is dataframe["column"].dt.month, and the year component is dataframe["column"].dt.year.

Once you have the year column, you can create a pivot table with the data aggregated by city and year, which you'll explore in the coming exercises.

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures is available.

    Add a year column to temperatures, from the year component of the date column.
    Make a pivot table of the avg_temp_c column, with country and city as rows, and year as columns. Assign to temp_by_country_city_vs_year, and look at the result.

# Add a year column to temperatures
temperatures["year"] = temperatures["date"].dt.year

# Pivot avg_temp_c by country and city vs year
temp_by_country_city_vs_year = temperatures.pivot_table("avg_temp_c", index = ["country", "city"], columns = "year")

# See the result
print(temp_by_country_city_vs_year)
