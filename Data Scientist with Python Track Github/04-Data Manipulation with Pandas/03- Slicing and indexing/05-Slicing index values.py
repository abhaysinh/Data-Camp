Slicing index values

Slicing lets you select consecutive elements of an object using first:last syntax. DataFrames can be sliced by index values, or by row/column number; we'll start with the first case. This involves slicing inside the .loc[] method.

Compared to slicing lists, there are a few things to remember.

    You can only slice an index if the index is sorted (using .sort_index()).
    To slice at the outer level, first and last can be strings.
    To slice at inner levels, first and last should be tuples.
    If you pass a single slice to .loc[], it will slice the rows.

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_ind has country and city in the index, and is available.

    Sort the index of temperatures_ind.
    Use slicing with .loc[] to get these subsets:
        from Pakistan to Russia.
        from Lahore to Moscow. (This will return nonsense.)
        from Pakistan, Lahore to Russia, Moscow.

# Sort the index of temperatures_ind
temperatures_srt = temperatures_ind.sort_index()

# Subset rows from Pakistan to Russia
print(temperatures_srt.loc["Pakistan":"Russia"])

# Try to subset rows from Lahore to Moscow
print(temperatures_srt.loc["Lahore":"Moscow"])

# Subset rows from Pakistan, Lahore to Russia, Moscow
print(temperatures_srt.loc[("Pakistan", "Lahore"):("Russia", "Moscow")])
