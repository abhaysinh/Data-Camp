Removing duplicates is an essential skill to get accurate counts, because often you don't want to count the same thing multiple times. In this exercise, you'll create some new DataFrames using unique values from sales.

sales is available and pandas is imported as pd.

# Drop duplicate store/type combinations

print(store_types.head())

# Drop duplicate store/department combinations
store_depts = sales.drop_duplicates(subset=["store", "department"])
print(store_depts.head())

# Subset the rows that are holiday weeks and drop duplicate dates
holiday_dates = sales[sales["is_holiday"]].drop_duplicates(subset="date")

# Print date col of holiday_dates
print(holiday_dates["date"])
