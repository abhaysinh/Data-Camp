'''
PMF of age

Do people tend to gain weight as they get older? We can answer this question by visualizing the relationship
between weight and age. But before we make a scatter plot, it is a good idea to visualize distributions one
variable at a time. Here, you'll visualize age using a bar chart first. Recall that all PMF objects have
a .bar() method to make a bar chart.

The BRFSS dataset includes a variable, 'AGE' (note the capitalization!), which represents each respondent's age.
To protect respondents' privacy, ages are rounded off into 5-year bins. 'AGE' contains the midpoint of the bins.

    Extract the variable 'AGE' from the DataFrame brfss and assign it to age.
    Plot the PMF of age as a bar chart.

# Extract AGE
age = brfss['AGE']

# Plot the PMF
Pmf(age).bar()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age in years')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.show()
