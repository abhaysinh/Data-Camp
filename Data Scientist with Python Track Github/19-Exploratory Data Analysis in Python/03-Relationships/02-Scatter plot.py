Scatter plot

Now let's make a scatterplot of weight versus age. To make the code run faster, I've selected only the first
1000 rows from the brfss DataFrame.

weight and age have already been extracted for you. Your job is to use plt.plot() to make a scatter plot.

# Select the first 1000 respondents
brfss = brfss[:1000]

# Extract age and weight
age = brfss['AGE']
weight = brfss['WTKG3']

# Make a scatter plot
plt.plot(age, weight, 'o', alpha=0.1)

plt.xlabel('Age in years')
plt.ylabel('Weight in kg')

plt.show()
