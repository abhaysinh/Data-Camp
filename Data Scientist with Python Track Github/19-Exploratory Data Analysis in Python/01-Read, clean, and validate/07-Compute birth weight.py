Compute birth weight

Now let's pull together the steps in this chapter to compute the average birth weight for full-term babies.

I've provided a function, resample_rows_weighted, that takes the NSFG data and resamples it using the
sampling weights in wgt2013_2015. The result is a sample that is representative of the U.S. population.

Then I extract birthwgt_lb1 and birthwgt_oz1, replace special codes with NaN, and compute total birth
weight in pounds, birth_weight.

# Resample the data
nsfg = resample_rows_weighted(nsfg, 'wgt2013_2015')

# Clean the weight variables
pounds = nsfg['birthwgt_lb1'].replace([98, 99], np.nan)
ounces = nsfg['birthwgt_oz1'].replace([98, 99], np.nan)

# Compute total birth weight
birth_weight = pounds + ounces/16

    Make a Boolean Series called full_term that is true for babies with 'prglngth' greater than or equal to 37 weeks.
    Use full_term and birth_weight to select birth weight in pounds for full-term babies. Store the result in full_term_weight.
    Compute the mean weight of full-term babies.

# Create a Boolean Series for full-term babies
full_term = nsfg['prglngth'] >= 37

# Select the weights of full-term babies
full_term_weight = birth_weight[full_term]

# Compute the mean weight of full-term babies
print(full_term_weight.mean())
