Clean a variable

In the NSFG dataset, the variable 'nbrnaliv' records the number of babies born alive at the end of a pregnancy.

If you use .value_counts() to view the responses, you'll see that the value 8 appears once, and if you consult
the codebook, you'll see that this value indicates that the respondent refused to answer the question.

Your job in this exercise is to replace this value with np.nan. Recall from the video how Allen replaced the values
98 and 99 in the ounces column using the .replace() method:

ounces.replace([98, 99], np.nan, inplace=True)

    In the 'nbrnaliv' column, replace the value 8, in place, with the special value NaN.
    Confirm that the value 8 no longer appears in this column by printing the values and their frequencies.

# Replace the value 8 with NaN
nsfg['nbrnaliv'].replace([8], np.nan, inplace=True)

# Print the values and their frequencies
print(nsfg['nbrnaliv'].value_counts())
