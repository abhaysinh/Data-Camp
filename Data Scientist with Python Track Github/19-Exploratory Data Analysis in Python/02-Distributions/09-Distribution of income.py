Distribution of income

In many datasets, the distribution of income is approximately lognormal, which means that the logarithms
of the incomes fit a normal distribution. We'll see whether that's true for the GSS data. As a first step,
you'll compute the mean and standard deviation of the log of incomes using NumPy's np.log10() function.

Then, you'll use the computed mean and standard deviation to make a norm object using the scipy.stats.norm() function.

    Extract 'realinc' from gss and compute its logarithm using np.log10().
    Compute the mean and standard deviation of the result.
    Make a norm object by passing the computed mean and standard deviation to norm().

# Extract realinc and compute its log
income = gss['realinc']
log_income = np.log10(income)

# Compute mean and standard deviation
mean = log_income.mean()
std = log_income.std()
print(mean, std)

# Make a norm object
from scipy.stats import norm
dist = norm(mean, std)
