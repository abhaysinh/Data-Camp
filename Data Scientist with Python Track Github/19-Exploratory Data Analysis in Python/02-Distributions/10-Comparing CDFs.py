Comparing CDFs

To see whether the distribution of income is well modeled by a lognormal distribution, we'll
compare the CDF of the logarithm of the data to a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation.
These variables from the previous exercise are available for use:

# Extract realinc and compute its log
log_income = np.log10(gss['realinc'])

# Compute mean and standard deviation
mean, std = log_income.mean(), log_income.std()

# Make a norm object
from scipy.stats import norm
dist = norm(mean, std)

dist is a scipy.stats.norm object with the same mean and standard deviation as the data. It provides .cdf(),
which evaluates the normal cumulative distribution function.

Be careful with capitalization: Cdf(), with an uppercase C, creates Cdf objects. dist.cdf(), with a lowercase c,
evaluates the normal cumulative distribution function.

Instructions
100 XP

    Evaluate the normal cumulative distribution function using dist.cdf.
    Use the Cdf() function to compute the CDF of log_income.
    Plot the result.

# Evaluate the model CDF
xs = np.linspace(2, 5.5)
ys = dist.cdf(xs)

# Plot the model CDF
plt.clf()
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray')

# Create and plot the Cdf of log_income
Cdf(log_income).plot()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('log10 of realinc')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.show()
