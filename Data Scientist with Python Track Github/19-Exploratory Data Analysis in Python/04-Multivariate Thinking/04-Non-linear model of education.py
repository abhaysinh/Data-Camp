Non-linear model of education

The graph in the previous exercise suggests that the relationship between income and education is non-linear.
So let's try fitting a non-linear model.

    Add a column named 'educ2' to the gss DataFrame; it should contain the values from 'educ' squared.
    Run a regression model that uses 'educ', 'educ2', 'age', and 'age2' to predict 'realinc'.

'''


import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Add a new column with educ squared
gss['educ2'] = gss['educ']**2

# Run a regression model with educ, educ2, age, and age2
results = smf.ols('realinc ~ educ + educ2 + age + age2', data=gss).fit()

# Print the estimated parameters
print(results.params)
