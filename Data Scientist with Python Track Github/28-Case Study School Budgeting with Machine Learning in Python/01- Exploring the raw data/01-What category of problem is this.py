What category of problem is this?

You're no novice to data science, but let's make sure we agree on the basics.

As Peter from DrivenData explained in the video, you're going to be working with school district budget data.
This data can be classified in many ways according to certain labels, e.g. Function: Career & Academic Counseling,
or Position_Type: Librarian.

Your goal is to develop a model that predicts the probability for each possible label by relying on some correctly
labeled examples.

Possible Answers

    Reinforcement Learning, because the model is learning from the data through a system of rewards and punishments.

    Unsupervised Learning, because the model doesn't output labels with certainty.

    Unsupervised Learning, because not all data is correctly classified to begin with.

    Supervised Learning, because the model will be trained using labeled examples.

Answer :  Supervised Learning, because the model will be trained using labeled examples.
