What tactics got the winner the best score?

Now you've implemented the winning model from start to finish. If you want to use this model locally,
this Jupyter notebook (https://github.com/datacamp/course-resources-ml-with-experts-budgets/blob/master/notebooks/1.0-full-model.ipynb)
contains all the code you've worked so hard on. You can now take that code and build on it!

Let's take a moment to reflect on why this model did so well. What tactics got the winner the best score?
