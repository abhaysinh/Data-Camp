Visualizing standard deviation with line plots

In the last exercise, we looked at how the average miles per gallon achieved by cars has changed over time.
Now let's use a line plot to visualize how the distribution of miles per gallon has changed over time.

Seaborn has been imported as sns and matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt.

    Change the plot so the shaded area shows the standard deviation instead of the confidence interval for the mean.

# Make the shaded area show the standard deviation
sns.relplot(x="model_year", y="mpg",
            data=mpg, kind="line",
            ci="sd")


# Show plot
plt.show()
