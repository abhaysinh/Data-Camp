Adding a title and axis labels

Let's continue to look at the miles per gallon dataset. This time we'll create a line plot to answer the question:
How does the average miles per gallon achieved by cars change over time for each of the three places of origin?
To improve the readability of this plot, we'll add a title and more informative axis labels.

In the code provided, we create the line plot using the lineplot() function. Note that lineplot() does not
support the creation of subplots, so it returns an AxesSubplot object instead of an FacetGrid object.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

Instructions

    1 Add the following title to the plot: "Average MPG Over Time". p- 50 XP

    2 Label the x-axis as "Car Model Year" and the y-axis as "Average MPG". - 50 XP

# Create line plot
g = sns.lineplot(x="model_year", y="mpg_mean",
                 data=mpg_mean,
                 hue="origin")

# Add a title "Average MPG Over Time"
g.set_title("Average MPG Over Time")

# Show plot
plt.show()


# Create line plot
g = sns.lineplot(x="model_year", y="mpg_mean",
                 data=mpg_mean,
                 hue="origin")

# Add a title "Average MPG Over Time"
g.set_title("Average MPG Over Time")

# Add x-axis and y-axis labels
g.set(xlabel="Car Model Year",
      ylabel="Average MPG")

# Show plot
plt.show()
