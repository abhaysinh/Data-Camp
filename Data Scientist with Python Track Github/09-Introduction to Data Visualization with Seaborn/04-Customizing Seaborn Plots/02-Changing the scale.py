Changing the scale

In this exercise, we'll continue to look at the dataset containing responses from a survey of young people.
Does the percentage of people reporting that they feel lonely vary depending on how many siblings they have?
Let's find out using a bar plot, while also exploring Seaborn's four different plot scales ("contexts").

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

Instructions


    1 Set the scale ("context") to "paper", which is the smallest of the scale options. - 25 XP

    2 Change the context to "notebook" to increase the scale. - 25 XP

    3 Change the context to "talk" to increase the scale. 25 XP

    4 Change the context to "poster", which is the largest scale available. 25 XP
