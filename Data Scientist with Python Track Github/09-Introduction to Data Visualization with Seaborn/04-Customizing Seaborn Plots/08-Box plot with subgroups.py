Box plot with subgroups

In this exercise, we'll look at the dataset containing responses from a survey given to young people.
One of the questions asked of the young people was: "Are you interested in having pets?"
Let's explore whether the distribution of ages of those answering "yes" tends to be higher or lower than
those answering "no", controlling for gender.
