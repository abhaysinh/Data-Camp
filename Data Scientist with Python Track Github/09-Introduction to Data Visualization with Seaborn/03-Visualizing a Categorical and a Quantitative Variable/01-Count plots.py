Count plots

In this exercise, we'll return to exploring our dataset that contains the responses to a survey sent out
to young people. We might suspect that young people spend a lot of time on the internet, but how much do
they report using the internet each day? Let's use a count plot to break down the number of survey responses
in each category and then explore whether it changes based on age.

As a reminder, to create a count plot, we'll use the catplot() function and specify the name of the categorical
variable to count (x=____), the Pandas DataFrame to use (data=____), and the type of plot (kind="count").

Seaborn has been imported as sns and matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt.

Instructions


    1 Use sns.catplot() to create a count plot using the survey_data DataFrame with "Internet usage" on the x-axis. 35 XP
    2 Make the bars horizontal instead of vertical. 35 XP
    3 Create column subplots based on "Age Category", which separates respondents into those that are younger '
    than 21 vs. 21 and older. 30 XP

# Create count plot of internet usage
sns.catplot(x="Internet usage", data=survey_data, kind="count")

# Show plot
plt.show()


# Change the orientation of the plot
sns.catplot(y="Internet usage", data=survey_data, kind="count")

# Show plot
plt.show()


# Create column subplots based on age category
sns.catplot(y="Internet usage", data=survey_data,
            kind="count", col="Age Category")

# Show plot
plt.show()
