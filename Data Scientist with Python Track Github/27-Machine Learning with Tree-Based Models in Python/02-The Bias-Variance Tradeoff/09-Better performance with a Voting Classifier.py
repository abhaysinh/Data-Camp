'''
Better performance with a Voting Classifier

Finally, you'll evaluate the performance of a voting classifier that takes the outputs of the
models defined in the list classifiers and assigns labels by majority voting.

X_train, X_test,y_train, y_test, the list classifiers defined in a previous exercise, as well as the function
accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics are available in your workspace.

Instructions

    1   Import VotingClassifier from sklearn.ensemble.

    2   Instantiate a VotingClassifier by setting the parameter estimators to classifiers and assign it to vc.

    3   Fit vc to the training set.

    4   Evaluate vc's test set accuracy using the test set predictions y_pred.

# Fit vc to the training set
vc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the test set predictions
