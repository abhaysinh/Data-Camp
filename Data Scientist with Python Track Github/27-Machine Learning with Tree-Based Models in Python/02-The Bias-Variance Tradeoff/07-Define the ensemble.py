Define the ensemble

In the following set of exercises, you'll work with the
Indian Liver Patient Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/jeevannagaraj/indian-liver-patient-dataset) from the
UCI Machine learning repository.

In this exercise, you'll instantiate three classifiers to predict whether a patient suffers from a liver disease
using all the features present in the dataset.

The classes LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier under the alias KNN are available
in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP

    1   Instantiate a Logistic Regression classifier and assign it to lr.

    2   Instantiate a KNN classifier that considers 27 nearest neighbors and assign it to knn.

    3   Instantiate a Decision Tree Classifier with the parameter min_samples_leaf set to 0.13 and assign it to dt.

# Set seed for reproducibility
SEED=1

# Instantiate lr
lr = LogisticRegression(random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate knn
knn = KNN(n_neighbors=27)

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=0.13, random_state=SEED)

# Define the list classifiers
classifiers = [('Logistic Regression', lr), ('K Nearest Neighbours', knn), ('Classification Tree', dt)]
