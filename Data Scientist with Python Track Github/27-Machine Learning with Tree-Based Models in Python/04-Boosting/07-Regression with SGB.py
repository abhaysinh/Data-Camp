'''
Regression with SGB

As in the exercises from the previous lesson, you'll be working with the
Bike Sharing Demand dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand).
In the following set of exercises, you'll solve this bike count
regression problem using stochastic gradient boosting.

Instructions
100 XP

    1   Instantiate a Stochastic Gradient Boosting Regressor (SGBR) and set:
            -max_depth to 4 and n_estimators to 200,
            -subsample to 0.9, and
            -max_features to 0.75.

# Import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

# Instantiate sgbr
sgbr = GradientBoostingRegressor(max_depth=4,
                                 subsample=0.9,
                                 max_features=0.75,
                                 n_estimators=200,
                                 random_state=2)
