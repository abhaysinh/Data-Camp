Train the SGB regressor

In this exercise, you'll train the SGBR sgbr instantiated in the previous exercise and predict the test set labels.

The bike sharing demand dataset is already loaded processed for you; it is split into 80% train and 20% test.
The feature matrices X_train and X_test, the arrays of labels y_train and y_test, and the model instance sgbr
that you defined in the previous exercise are available in your workspace.

Instructions

    1   Fit sgbr to the training set.

    2   Predict the test set labels and assign the results to y_pred.

# Fit sgbr to the training set
sgbr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = sgbr.predict(X_test)
