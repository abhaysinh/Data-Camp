Train the GB regressor

You'll now train the gradient boosting regressor gb that you instantiated in the previous exercise and predict test set labels.

The dataset is split into 80% train and 20% test. Feature matrices X_train and X_test, as well as
the arrays y_train and y_test are available in your workspace. In addition, we have also loaded the model instance
gb that you defined in the previous exercise.

Instructions
100 XP

    1   Fit gb to the training set.

    2   Predict the test set labels and assign the result to y_pred.

# Fit gb to the training set
gb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = gb.predict(X_test)
