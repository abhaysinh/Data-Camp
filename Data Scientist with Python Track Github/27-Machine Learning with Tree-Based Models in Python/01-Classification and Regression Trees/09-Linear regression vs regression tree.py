Linear regression vs regression tree

In this exercise, you'll compare the test set RMSE of dt to that achieved by a linear regression model.
We have already instantiated a linear regression model lr and trained it on the same dataset as dt.

The features matrix X_test, the array of labels y_test, the trained linear regression model lr,
mean_squared_error function which was imported under the alias MSE and rmse_dt from the previous exercise are
available in your workspace.

Instructions

    1   Predict test set labels using the linear regression model (lr) and assign the result to y_pred_lr.

    2   Compute the test set MSE and assign the result to mse_lr.

    3   Compute the test set RMSE and assign the result to rmse_lr.

# Predict test set labels
y_pred_lr = lr.predict(X_test)

# Compute mse_lr
mse_lr = MSE(y_test, y_pred_lr)

# Compute rmse_lr
rmse_lr = mse_lr**(1/2)

# Print rmse_lr
print('Linear Regression test set RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(rmse_lr))

# Print rmse_dt
print('Regression Tree test set RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(rmse_dt))
