Train your first regression tree

In this exercise, you'll train a regression tree to predict the mpg (miles per gallon) consumption of
cars in the auto-mpg dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/autompg-dataset) using all the six available features.

The dataset is processed for you and is split to 80% train and 20% test.
The features matrix X_train and the array y_train are available in your workspace.

    1   Import DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree.

    2   Instantiate a DecisionTreeRegressor dt with maximum depth 8 and min_samples_leaf set to 0.13.

    3   Fit dt to the training set.
