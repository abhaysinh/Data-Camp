    The existence of a node depends on the state of its predecessors.

    The impurity of a node can be determined using different criteria such as entropy and the gini-index.

    When the information gain resulting from splitting a node is null, the node is declared as a leaf.

    When an internal node is split, the split is performed in such a way so that information gain is minimized.

Answer  :  When an internal node is split, the split is performed in such a way so that information gain is minimized.
