Train your first classification tree

In this exercise you'll work with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
from the UCI machine learning repository. You'll predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on two
features: the mean radius of the tumor (radius_mean) and its mean number of concave points (concave points_mean).

The dataset is already loaded in your workspace and is split into 80% train and 20% test.
The feature matrices are assigned to X_train and X_test, while the arrays of labels are assigned to y_train
and y_test where class 1 corresponds to a malignant tumor and class 0 corresponds to a benign tumor.
To obtain reproducible results, we also defined a variable called SEED which is set to 1.

Instructions
100 XP

    1   Import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree.

    2   Instantiate a DecisionTreeClassifier dt of maximum depth equal to 6.

    3   Fit dt to the training set.

    4   Predict the test set labels and assign the result to y_pred.
