Visualizing features importances

In this exercise, you'll determine which features were the most predictive according to the random forests
regressor rf that you trained in a previous exercise.

For this purpose, you'll draw a horizontal barplot of the feature importance as assessed by rf.
Fortunately, this can be done easily thanks to plotting capabilities of pandas.

We have created a pandas.Series object called importances containing the feature names as index and their
importances as values. In addition, matplotlib.pyplot is available as plt and pandas as pd.

    1   Call the .sort_values() method on importances and assign the result to importances_sorted.

    2   Call the .plot() method on importances_sorted and set the arguments:
            -kind to 'barh'
            -color to 'lightgreen'

# Create a pd.Series of features importances
importances = pd.Series(data=rf.feature_importances_,
                        index= X_train.columns)

# Sort importances
importances_sorted = importances.sort_values()

# Draw a horizontal barplot of importances_sorted
importances_sorted.plot(kind='barh', color='lightgreen')
plt.title('Features Importances')
plt.show()
