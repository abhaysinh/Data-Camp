Random forests hyperparameters

In the following exercises, you'll be revisiting the Bike Sharing Demand dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)
that was introduced in a previous chapter. Recall that your task is to predict the bike rental demand using historical
weather data from the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.. For this purpose, you'll be tuning the
hyperparameters of a Random Forests regressor.

We have instantiated a RandomForestRegressor called rf using sklearn's default hyperparameters.
You can inspect the hyperparameters of rf in your console.

Which of the following is not a hyperparameter of rf?
