Activity tracker

Jane's New Year's resolution this year was to get into the best shape of her life. To help her achieve this goal she decided to invest in an activity tracker. After some months of tracking her activity, there is quite some data available.

The company that manufactured the activity tracker has a public API that allows access to your personal data. Jane is specifically interested in the GPS data of her runs because she wants to make a heatmap showing her most common running routes.

What type of data will she be extracting from the API?
