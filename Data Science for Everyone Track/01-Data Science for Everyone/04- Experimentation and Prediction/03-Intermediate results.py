Alondra is overseeing an A/B test for MeowMail, a subscription service that sends cat food to customers every month.

The A/B test is comparing the original cancellation workflow to a new workflow where the user is shown the amount of money they have saved by using MeowMail and asked if they're sure they want to cancel.

Alondra's team has prepared a slide summarizing the current state of the experiment, which is not yet finished. The slide shows a bar plot with error bars denoting uncertainty. What can Alondra conclude from this slide?

Possible Answers

    It looks like the bar representing the new workflow has a slightly lower cancellation rate than the bar representing the old workflow, so Alondra should stop the test and switch to the new workflow.

    The number of users exposed to the test has not yet reached the desired sample size, so Alondra should wait and make her judgment after the desired sample size has been reached.

    The results are not yet significant, so Alondra should cancel the test and keep using the old workflow.
