Possible Answers

    The data and graph can't be incorrect. As the graph shows, the star had to have been stable, except for a brief
        spike in mid-2012. Scientists should focus on what made that star spike in luminosity.

    Something weird is going on. That jump here is probably due to an outlier.

    If scientists and journalists say the star is dimming, then the star is dimming. It does not matter that the
        data states otherwise.

Answer : Something weird is going on. That jump here is probably due to an outlier.
