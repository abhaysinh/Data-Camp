A few years ago, KIC 8462852, also known as Tabby's star, started decreasing strongly in luminosity. We're not sure why yet, but scientists are investigating by recording observations at different times and locations.

Below are some descriptive statistics on the observations. Unlike the qualitative dataset we saw in the video, the Tabby's star dataset is made of quantitative data only, so we get statistics, like the mean and median.
