Interactive dashboards

Dashboards are great, interactive dashboards are even better. On the right, there is a dashboard made for tracking a website activity. We have the average page visit length segmented by age (top left), the number of visits today (top right), the monthly active users over time (bottom left), and the source of traffic segmented by month (bottom right).

If you hover over bar and line graphs, you will see some interactivity. Using this interactivity, how much website traffic in March was from search engines?
