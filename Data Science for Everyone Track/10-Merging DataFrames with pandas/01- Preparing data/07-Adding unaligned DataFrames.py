'''Adding unaligned DataFrames

The DataFrames january and february, which have been printed in the IPython Shell, represent the sales a company made in the corresponding months.

The Indexes in both DataFrames are called Company, identifying which company bought that quantity of units. The column Units is the number of units sold.

If you were to add these two DataFrames by executing the command total = january + february, how many rows would the resulting DataFrame have? Try this in the IPython Shell and find out for yourself.
