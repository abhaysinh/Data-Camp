'''
Merging the DataFrames

In this exercise, you'll merge the ri and weather_rating DataFrames into a new DataFrame, ri_weather.

The DataFrames will be joined using the stop_date column from ri and the DATE column from weather_rating.
Thankfully the date formatting matches exactly, which is not always the case!

Once the merge is complete, you'll set stop_datetime as the index, which is the column you saved in the previous exercise.

    Examine the shape of the ri DataFrame.
    Merge the ri and weather_rating DataFrames using a left join.
    Examine the shape of ri_weather to confirm that it has two more columns but the same number of rows as ri.
    Replace the index of ri_weather with the stop_datetime column.
