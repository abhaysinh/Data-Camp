Plotting violations by district

Now that you've created a frequency table focused on the "K" zones, you'll visualize the data to help you
compare what violations are being caught in each zone.

First you'll create a bar plot, which is an appropriate plot type since you're comparing categorical data.
Then you'll create a stacked bar plot in order to get a slightly different look at the data.
Which plot do you find to be more insightful?


Instructions
