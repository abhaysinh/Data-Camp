Plotting drug-related stops

In a small portion of traffic stops, drugs are found in the vehicle during a search.
In this exercise, you'll assess whether these drug-related stops are becoming more common over time.

The Boolean column drugs_related_stop indicates whether drugs were found during a given stop.
You'll calculate the annual drug rate by resampling this column, and then you'll use a line plot to
visualize how the rate has changed over time.

    Calculate the annual rate of drug-related stops by resampling the drugs_related_stop column
    (on the 'A' frequency) and taking the mean.
    Save the annual drug rate Series as a new object, annual_drug_rate.
    Create a line plot of annual_drug_rate using the .plot() method.
    Display the plot using the .show() function.

# Calculate the annual rate of drug-related stops

# Save the annual rate of drug-related stops
annual_drug_rate = ri.drugs_related_stop.resample('A').mean()

# Create a line plot of 'annual_drug_rate'
annual_drug_rate.plot()
