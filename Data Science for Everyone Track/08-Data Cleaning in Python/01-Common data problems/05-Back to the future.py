Back to the future

A new update to the data pipeline feeding into the ride_sharing DataFrame has been updated to register each ride's date.
This information is stored in the ride_date column of the type object, which represents strings in pandas.

A bug was discovered which was relaying rides taken today as taken next year. To fix this, you will find all instances
of the ride_date column that occur anytime in the future, and set the maximum possible value of this column to today's
date. Before doing so, you would need to convert ride_date to a datetime object.

The datetime package has been imported as dt, alongside all the packages you've been using till now.

    Convert ride_date to a datetime object and store it in ride_dt column using to_datetime().
    Create the variable today, which stores today's date by using the dt.date.today() function.
    For all instances of ride_dt in the future, set them to today's date.
    Print the maximum date in the ride_dt column.

# Convert ride_date to datetime
ride_sharing['ride_dt'] = pd.to_datetime(ride_sharing['ride_date'])

# Save today's date
today = dt.date.today()

# Set all in the future to today's date
ride_sharing.loc[ride_sharing['ride_dt'] > today, 'ride_dt'] = today

# Print maximum of ride_dt column
print(ride_sharing['ride_dt'].max())
