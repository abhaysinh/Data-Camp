Is this missing at random?

You've seen in the video exercise how there are a variety of missingness types when observing missing data.
As a reminder, missingness types can be described as the following:

    Missing Completely at Random: No systematic relationship between a column's missing values and other or own values.
    Missing at Random: There is a systematic relationship between a column's missing values and other observed values.
    Missing not at Random: There is a systematic relationship between a column's missing values and unobserved values.
