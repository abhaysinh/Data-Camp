Pairs of restaurants

In the last lesson, you cleaned the restaurants dataset to make it ready for building a restaurants recommendation engine.
 You have a new DataFrame named restaurants_new with new restaurants to train your model on, that's been scraped from
 a new data source.

You've already cleaned the cuisine_type and city columns using the techniques learned throughout the course.
However you saw duplicates with typos in restaurants names that require record linkage instead of joins with restaurants.

In this exercise, you will perform the first step in record linkage and generate possible pairs of rows between
restaurants and restaurants_new. Both DataFrames, pandas and recordlinkage are in your environment.

Instructions

    1 Instantiate an indexing object by using the Index() function from recordlinkage.   - 50 XP
    Block your pairing on cuisine_type by using indexer's' .block() method.
    Generate pairs by indexing restaurants and restaurants_new in that order.

    2 Question           - 50 XP

    Now that you've generated your pairs, you've achieved the first step of record linkage.
    What are the steps remaining to link both restaurants DataFrames, and in what order?

    Possible Answers

    Compare between columns, score the comparison, then link the DataFrames.
    Clean the data, compare between columns, link the DataFrames, then score the comparison.
    Clean the data, compare between columns, score the comparison, then link the DataFrames.

Answer : Compare between columns, score the comparison, then link the DataFrames.

# Create an indexer and object and find possible pairs
indexer = recordlinkage.Index()

# Block pairing on cuisine_type
indexer.block('cuisine_type')

# Generate pairs
pairs = indexer.index(restaurants, restaurants_new)
