Counting categorical variables

Counting is a great way to get an overview of your data and to spot curiosities that you might not notice otherwise. In this exercise, you'll count the number of each type of store and the number of each department number.

The stores and departments DataFrames you created in the last exercise are available and pandas is imported as pd.
