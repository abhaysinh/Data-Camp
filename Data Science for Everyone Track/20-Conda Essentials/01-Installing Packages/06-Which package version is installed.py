Which package version is installed?

Because conda installs packages automatically, it's hard to know which package versions are actually on your system. That is, packages you didn't install explicitly get installed for you to resolve another package's dependencies.

Fortunately, the command conda list comes to your aid to query the current state. By itself, this lists all packages currently installed.
You can use conda list --help to see how to extract specific packages from that list or how to display it in different formats.

Select the exact version of the package requests installed in the current session.
