Evaluate the AdaBoost classifier

Now that you're done training ada and predicting the probabilities of obtaining the positive class
in the test set, it's time to evaluate ada's ROC AUC score. Recall that the ROC AUC score of a binary classifier
can be determined using the roc_auc_score() function from sklearn.metrics.

The arrays y_test and y_pred_proba that you computed in the previous exercise are available in your workspace.

    1   Import roc_auc_score from sklearn.metrics.

    2   Compute ada's test set ROC AUC score, assign it to ada_roc_auc, and print it out.

# Import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

# Evaluate test-set roc_auc_score
ada_roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba)

# Print roc_auc_score
print('ROC AUC score: {:.2f}'.format(ada_roc_auc))
