Evaluate the GB regressor

Now that the test set predictions are available, you can use them to evaluate the test set Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of gb.

y_test and predictions y_pred are available in your workspace.

Instructions

    1   Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE.

    2   Compute the test set MSE and assign it to mse_test.

    3   Compute the test set RMSE and assign it to rmse_test.

# Import mean_squared_error as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Compute MSE
mse_test = MSE(y_test, y_pred)

# Compute RMSE
rmse_test = mse_test**(1/2)

# Print RMSE
print('Test set RMSE of gb: {:.3f}'.format(rmse_test))
