Complexity, bias and variance

In the video, you saw how the complexity of a model labeled f^
influences the bias and variance terms of its generalization error.

Possible Answers

    As the complexity of f^ decreases, the bias term decreases while the variance term increases.

    As the complexity of f^ decreases, both the bias and the variance terms increase.

    As the complexity of f^ increases, the bias term increases while the variance term decreases.

    As the complexity of f^ increases, the bias term decreases while the variance term increases.

Answer : As the complexity of f^ increases, the bias term decreases while the variance term increases.
