Even more aliasing

Let's practice your newfound aliasing skills some more before moving on!

Recall: SQL assumes that if you divide an integer by an integer, you want to get an integer back.

This means that the following will erroneously result in 400.0:

SELECT 45 / 10 * 100.0;

This is because 45 / 10 evaluates to an integer (4), and not a decimal number like we would expect.

So when you're dividing make sure at least one of your numbers has a decimal place:

SELECT 45 * 100.0 / 10;

The above now gives the correct answer of 450.0 since the numerator (45 * 100.0) of the division is now a decimal!

Instructions
100 XP

    Get the percentage of people who are no longer alive. Alias the result as percentage_dead. Remember to use 100.0 and not 100!

    Get the number of years between the newest film and oldest film. Alias the result as difference.

    Get the number of decades the films table covers. Alias the result as number_of_decades.
        The top half of your fraction should be enclosed in parentheses.

-- get the count(deathdate) and multiply by 100.0
-- then divide by count(*)
SELECT COUNT(deathdate) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS percentage_dead
FROM people;


SELECT MAX(release_year) - MIN(release_year) AS difference
FROM films;


SELECT (MAX(release_year) - MIN(release_year)) / 10.0
AS number_of_decades
FROM films;
