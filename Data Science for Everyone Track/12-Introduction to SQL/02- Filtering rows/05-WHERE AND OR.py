WHERE AND OR

What if you want to select rows based on multiple conditions where some but not all of the conditions need to be met? For this, SQL has the OR operator.

For example, the following returns all films released in either 1994 or 2000:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1994
OR release_year = 2000;

Note that you need to specify the column for every OR condition, so the following is invalid:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1994 OR 2000;

When combining AND and OR, be sure to enclose the individual clauses in parentheses, like so:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');

Otherwise, due to SQL's precedence rules, you may not get the results you're expecting!

What does the OR operator do?
