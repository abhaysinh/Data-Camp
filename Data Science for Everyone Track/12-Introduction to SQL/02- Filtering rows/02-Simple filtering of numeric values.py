Simple filtering of numeric values

As you learned in the previous exercise, the WHERE clause can also be used to filter numeric records, such as years or ages.

For example, the following query selects all details for films with a budget over ten thousand dollars:

SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE budget > 10000;

Now it's your turn to use the WHERE clause to filter numeric values!
