BETWEEN

As you've learned, you can use the following query to get titles of all films released in and between 1994 and 2000:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year >= 1994
AND release_year <= 2000;

Checking for ranges like this is very common, so in SQL the BETWEEN keyword provides a useful shorthand for filtering values within a specified range. This query is equivalent to the one above:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year
BETWEEN 1994 AND 2000;

It's important to remember that BETWEEN is inclusive, meaning the beginning and end values are included in the results!
