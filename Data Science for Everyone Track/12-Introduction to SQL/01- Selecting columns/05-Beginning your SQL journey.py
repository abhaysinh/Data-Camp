Beginning your SQL journey

Now that you're familiar with the interface, let's get straight into it.

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a language for interacting with data stored in something called a relational database.

You can think of a relational database as a collection of tables. A table is just a set of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet, which represents exactly one type of entity. For example, a table might represent employees in a company or purchases made, but not both.

Each row, or record, of a table contains information about a single entity. For example, in a table representing employees, each row represents a single person. Each column, or field, of a table contains a single attribute for all rows in the table. For example, in a table representing employees, we might have a column containing first and last names for all employees.

The table of employees might look something like this:
id 	name 	age 	nationality
1 	Jessica 	22 	Ireland
2 	Gabriel 	48 	France
3 	Laura 	36 	USA

How many fields does the employees table above contain?
