SELECTing multiple columns

Well done! Now you know how to select single columns.

In the real world, you will often want to select multiple columns. Luckily, SQL makes this really easy. To select multiple columns from a table, simply separate the column names with commas!

For example, this query selects two columns, name and birthdate, from the people table:

SELECT name, birthdate
FROM people;

Sometimes, you may want to select all columns from a table. Typing out every column name would be a pain, so there's a handy shortcut:

SELECT *
FROM people;

If you only want to return a certain number of results, you can use the LIMIT keyword to limit the number of rows returned:

SELECT *
FROM people
LIMIT 10;
