Sorting multiple columns

ORDER BY can also be used to sort on multiple columns. It will sort by the first column specified, then sort by the next, then the next, and so on. For example,

SELECT birthdate, name
FROM people
ORDER BY birthdate, name;

sorts on birth dates first (oldest to newest) and then sorts on the names in alphabetical order. The order of columns is important!

Try using ORDER BY to sort multiple columns! Remember, to specify multiple columns you separate the column names with a comma.
