NMF reconstructs samples

In this exercise, you'll check your understanding of how NMF reconstructs samples from its components using
the NMF feature values. On the right are the components of an NMF model. If the NMF feature values of a sample
are [2, 1], then which of the following is most likely to represent the original sample?
A pen and paper will help here! You have to apply the same technique Ben used in the video to reconstruct the
sample [0.1203 0.1764 0.3195 0.141].
