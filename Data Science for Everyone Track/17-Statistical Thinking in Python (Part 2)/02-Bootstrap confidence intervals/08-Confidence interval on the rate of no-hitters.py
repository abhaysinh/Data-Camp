Confidence interval on the rate of no-hitters

Consider again the inter-no-hitter intervals for the modern era of baseball.
Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the optimal parameter τ

. Plot a histogram of your replicates and report a 95% confidence interval.

Instructions

    1   Generate 10000 bootstrap replicates of τ from the nohitter_times data using your draw_bs_reps() function.
        Recall that the optimal τ is calculated as the mean of the data.

    2   Compute the 95% confidence interval using np.percentile() and passing in two arguments:
        The array bs_replicates, and the list of percentiles - in this case 2.5 and 97.5.

    3   Print the confidence interval.
    4   Plot a histogram of your bootstrap replicates. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!

# Draw bootstrap replicates of the mean no-hitter time (equal to tau): bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(nohitter_times, np.mean, size=10000)

# Compute the 95% confidence interval: conf_int
conf_int = np.percentile(bs_replicates, [2.5, 97.5])

# Print the confidence interval
print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'games')

# Plot the histogram of the replicates
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel(r'$\tau$ (games)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
