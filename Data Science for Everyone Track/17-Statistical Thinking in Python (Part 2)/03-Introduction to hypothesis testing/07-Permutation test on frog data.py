Permutation test on frog data

The average strike force of Frog A was 0.71 Newtons (N), and that of Frog B was 0.42 N for a difference of 0.29 N.
It is possible the frogs strike with the same force and this observed difference was by chance.
You will compute the probability of getting at least a 0.29 N difference in mean strike force under the
hypothesis that the distributions of strike forces for the two frogs are identical. We use a permutation
test with a test statistic of the difference of means to test this hypothesis.

For your convenience, the data has been stored in the arrays force_a and force_b.

    1   Define a function with call signature diff_of_means(data_1, data_2) that returns the differences in
        means between two data sets, mean of data_1 minus mean of data_2.

    2   Use this function to compute the empirical difference of means that was observed in the frogs.

    3   Draw 10,000 permutation replicates of the difference of means.

    4   Compute the p-value.

    5   Print the p-value.
