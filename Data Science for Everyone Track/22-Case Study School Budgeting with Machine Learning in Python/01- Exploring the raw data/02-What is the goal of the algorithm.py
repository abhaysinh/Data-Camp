What is the goal of the algorithm?

As you know from previous courses, there are different types of supervised machine learning problems.
In this exercise you will tell us what type of supervised machine learning problem this is, and why you think so.

Remember, your goal is to correctly label budget line items by training a supervised model to predict the
probability of each possible label, taking most probable label as the correct label.

Possible Answers

    Regression, because the model will output probabilities.

    Classification, because predicted probabilities will be used to select a label class.

    Regression, because probabilities take a continuous value between 0 and 1.

    Classification, because the model will output probabilities.

Answer :   Classification, because predicted probabilities will be used to select a label class.
