Can you adjust the model or parameters to improve accuracy?

You just saw a substantial improvement in accuracy by swapping out the model. Pipelines are amazing!

Can you make it better? Try changing the parameter n_estimators of RandomForestClassifier(), whose default value is 10, to 15.


Instructions
100 XP

    1   Import the RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble.

    2   Add a RandomForestClassifier() step with n_estimators=15 to the pipeline with a name of 'clf'.

    3   Hit 'Submit Answer' to fit the pipeline to the training data and compute its accuracy.

# Import RandomForestClassifier

# Add model step to pipeline: pl

# Fit to the training data
pl.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Compute and print accuracy
accuracy = pl.score(X_test, y_test)
