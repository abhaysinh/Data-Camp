Save a figure with different sizes

Before saving your visualization, you might want to also set the size that the figure will have on the page.
To do so, you can use the Figure object's set_size_inches method. This method takes a sequence of two values.
The first sets the width and the second sets the height of the figure.

Here, you will again have a Figure object called fig already provided
(you can run plt.show if you want to see its contents). Use the Figure methods set_size_inches and savefig to change
its size and save two different versions of this figure.
