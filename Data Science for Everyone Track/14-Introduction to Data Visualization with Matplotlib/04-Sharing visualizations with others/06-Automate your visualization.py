Automate your visualization

One of the main strengths of Matplotlib is that it can be automated to adapt to the data that it receives as input.
For example, if you receive data that has an unknown number of categories, you can still create a bar plot that has
 bars for each category.

This is what you will do in this exercise. You will be visualizing data about medal winners in the 2016 summer
Olympic Games again, but this time you will have a dataset that has some unknown number of branches of sports in it.
This will be loaded into memory as a Pandas DataFrame object called summer_2016_medals, which has a column called
"Sport" that tells you to which branch of sport each row corresponds. There is also a "Weight" column that tells you
the weight of each athlete.

Instructions

    Iterate over the values of sports setting sport as your loop variable.
    In each iteration, extract the rows where the "Sport" column is equal to sport.
    Add a bar to the provided ax object, labeled with the sport name, with the mean of the "Weight" column as
    its height, and the standard deviation as a y-axis error bar.
    Save the figure into the file "sports_weights.png".

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Loop over the different sports branches
for sport in sports:
  # Extract the rows only for this sport
  sport_df = summer_2016_medals[summer_2016_medals["Sport"] == sport]
  # Add a bar for the "Weight" mean with std y error bar
  ax.bar(sport, sport_df["Weight"].mean(), yerr=sport_df["Weight"].std())

ax.set_ylabel("Weight")
ax.set_xticklabels(sports, rotation=90)

# Save the figure to file
fig.savefig("sports_weights.png")
