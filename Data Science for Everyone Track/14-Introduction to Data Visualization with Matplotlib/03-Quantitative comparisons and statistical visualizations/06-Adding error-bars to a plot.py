Adding error-bars to a plot

Adding error-bars to a plot is done by using the errorbars method of the Axes object.

Here, you have two DataFrames loaded: seattle_weather has data about the weather in Seattle and
austin_weather has data about the weather in Austin. Each DataFrame has a column "MONTH" that has the names of
the months, a column "MLY-TAVG-NORMAL" that has the average temperature in each month and a column
"MLY-TAVG-STDDEV" that has the standard deviation of the temperatures across years.

In the exercise, you will plot the mean temperature across months and add the standard deviation at each point as y errorbars.

    Use the ax.errorbar method to add the Seattle data: the "MONTH" column as x values, the "MLY-TAVG-NORMAL" as y
    values and "MLY-TAVG-STDDEV" as yerr values.
    Add the Austin data: the "MONTH" column as x values, the "MLY-TAVG-NORMAL" as y values and "MLY-TAVG-STDDEV" as yerr values.
    Set the y-axis label as "Temperature (Fahrenheit)".

# Add the Seattle temperature data in each month with standard deviation error bars
ax.errorbar(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"], yerr=seattle_weather["MLY-TAVG-STDDEV"])

# Add the Austin temperature data in each month with standard deviation error bars
ax.errorbar(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"], yerr=austin_weather["MLY-TAVG-STDDEV"])

# Set the y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel("Temperature (Fahrenheit)")
