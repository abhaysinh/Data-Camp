Plot time-series data

To plot time-series data, we use the Axes object plot command. The first argument to this method are the values for the x-axis and the second argument are the values for the y-axis.

This exercise provides data stored in a DataFrame called climate_change. This variable has a time-index with the dates of measurements and two data columns: "co2" and "relative_temp".

In this case, the index of the DataFrame would be used as the x-axis values and we will plot the values stored in the "relative_temp" column as the y-axis values. We will also properly label the x-axis and y-axis.

    Add the data from climate_change to the plot: use the DataFrame index for the x value and the "relative_temp" column for the y values.
    Set the x-axis label to 'Time'.
    Set the y-axis label to 'Relative temperature (Celsius)'.
    Show the figure.

# Add the time-series for "relative_temp" to the plot
ax.plot(climate_change.index, climate_change['relative_temp'])

# Set the x-axis label
ax.set_xlabel('Time')

# Set the y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel('Relative temperature (Celsius)')
