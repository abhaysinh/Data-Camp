Customizing point plots

Let's continue to look at data from students in secondary school, this time using a point plot to answer the question:
does the quality of the student's family relationship influence the number of absences the student has in school?
Here, we'll use the "famrel" variable, which describes the quality of a student's family relationship from 1 (very bad)
to 5 (very good).

As a reminder, to create a point plot, use the catplot() function and specify the name of the categorical variable to
put on the x-axis (x=____), the name of the quantitative variable to summarize on the y-axis (y=____), the Pandas
DataFrame to use (data=____), and the type of categorical plot (kind="point").

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

Instructions


    1 Use sns.catplot() and the student_data DataFrame to create a point plot with "famrel" on the x-axis and
    number of absences ("absences") on the y-axis. 35 XP
    2 Add "caps" to the end of the confidence intervals with size 0.2. 35 XP
    3 Remove the lines joining the points in each category. 30 XP

# Create a point plot of family relationship vs. absences
sns.catplot(x="famrel", y="absences",
            data=student_data,
            kind="point")

# Show plot
plt.show()

# Add caps to the confidence interval
sns.catplot(x="famrel", y="absences",
            data=student_data,
            kind="point",
            capsize=0.2)

# Show plot
plt.show()

# Remove the lines joining the points
sns.catplot(x="famrel", y="absences",
            data=student_data,
            kind="point",
