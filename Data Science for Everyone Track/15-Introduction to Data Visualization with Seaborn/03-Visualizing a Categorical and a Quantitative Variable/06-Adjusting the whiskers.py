Adjusting the whiskers

In the lesson we saw that there are multiple ways to define the whiskers in a box plot.
In this set of exercises, we'll continue to use the student_data dataset to compare the distribution of final
grades ("G3") between students who are in a romantic relationship and those that are not. We'll use the "romantic"
variable, which is a yes/no indicator of whether the student is in a romantic relationship.

Let's create a box plot to look at this relationship and try different ways to define the whiskers.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

Instructions

    1 Adjust the code to make the box plot whiskers to extend to 0.5 * IQR. Recall: the IQR is the interquartile range. 35 XP
    2 Change the code to set the whiskers to extend to the 5th and 95th percentiles. 35 XP
    3 Change the code to set the whiskers to extend to the min and max values. 30 XP

# Set the whiskers to 0.5 * IQR
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="G3",
            data=student_data,
            kind="box")

# Show plot
plt.show()

# Extend the whiskers to the 5th and 95th percentile
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="G3",
            data=student_data,
            kind="box",
            whis=[5, 95])

# Show plot
plt.show()




# Set the whiskers at the min and max values
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="G3",
            data=student_data,
            kind="box",
            whis=[0, 100])

# Show plot
plt.show()
