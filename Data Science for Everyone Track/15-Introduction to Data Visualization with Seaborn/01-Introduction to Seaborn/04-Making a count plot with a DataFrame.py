Making a count plot with a DataFrame

In this exercise, we'll look at the responses to a survey sent out to young people.
Our primary question here is: how many young people surveyed report being scared of spiders?
Survey participants were asked to agree or disagree with the statement "I am afraid of spiders".
Responses vary from 1 to 5, where 1 is "Strongly disagree" and 5 is "Strongly agree".

The survey data is in a csv file located at csv_filepath.

    Import Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn using the standard names.
    Create a DataFrame named df from the csv file located at csv_filepath.
    Use the countplot() function with the x= and data= arguments to create a count plot with the "Spiders" column
    values on the x-axis.
    Display the plot.
