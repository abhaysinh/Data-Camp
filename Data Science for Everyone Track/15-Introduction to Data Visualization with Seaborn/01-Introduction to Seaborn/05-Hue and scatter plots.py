Hue and scatter plots

In the prior video, we learned how hue allows us to easily make subgroups within Seaborn plots.
Let's try it out by exploring data from students in secondary school. We have a lot of information about
each student like their age, where they live, their study habits and their extracurricular activities.

For now, we'll look at the relationship between the number of absences they have in school and their final
grade in the course, segmented by where the student lives (rural vs. urban area).

Instructions
50 XP

    1 Create a scatter plot with "absences" on the x-axis and final grade ("G3") on the y-axis using the DataFrame
    student_data. Color the plot points based on "location" (urban vs. rural).

    2 Make "Rural" appear before "Urban" in the plot legend.

# Import Matplotlib and Seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create a scatter plot of absences vs. final grade
sns.scatterplot(x="absences", y="G3",
                data=student_data,
                hue="location")

# Show plot
plt.show()
