'''
Changing the style of scatter plot points

Let's continue exploring Seaborn's mpg dataset by looking at the relationship between how fast a car
can accelerate ("acceleration") and its fuel efficiency ("mpg"). Do these properties vary by country of origin ("origin")?

Note that the "acceleration" variable is the time to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour, in seconds.
Higher values indicate slower acceleration.

    Use relplot() and the mpg DataFrame to create a scatter plot with "acceleration" on the x-axis and "mpg" on
    the y-axis. Vary the style and color of the plot points by country of origin ("origin").

# Import Matplotlib and Seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create a scatter plot of acceleration vs. mpg
sns.relplot(x="acceleration", y="mpg",
            data=mpg, kind="scatter",
            style="origin", hue="origin")

# Show plot
plt.show()
