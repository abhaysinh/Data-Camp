Any comments?

Something that Hugo didn't mention in his videos is that you can add comments to your Python scripts.
Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about.

To add comments to your Python script, you can use the # tag. These comments are not run as Python code, so
they will not influence your result. As an example, take the comment on the right, # Division; it is completely
ignored during execution.

Above the print(7 + 10), add the comment # Addition.
