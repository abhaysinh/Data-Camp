'''

Inner join with using

When joining tables with a common field name, e.g.

SELECT *
FROM countries
  INNER JOIN economies
    ON countries.code = economies.code

You can use USING as a shortcut:

SELECT *
FROM countries
  INNER JOIN economies
    USING(code)

You'll now explore how this can be done with the countries and languages tables.

    Inner join countries on the left and languages on the right with USING(code).
    Select the fields corresponding to:
        country name AS country,
        continent name,
        language name AS language, and
        whether or not the language is official.

Remember to alias your tables using the first letter of their names.
