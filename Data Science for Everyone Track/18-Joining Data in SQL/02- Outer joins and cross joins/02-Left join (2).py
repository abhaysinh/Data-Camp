Left join (2)

Next, you'll try out another example comparing an inner join to its corresponding left join. Before you begin though, take note of how many records are in both the countries and languages tables below.

You will begin with an inner join on the countries table on the left with the languages table on the right. Then you'll change the code to a left join in the next bullet.

Note the use of multi-line comments here using /* and */.

Instructions
100 XP

    1   Perform an inner join. Alias the name of the country field as country and the name of the language field as language.
        Sort based on descending country name.

    2   Perform a left join instead of an inner join. Observe the result, and also note the change in the number of records
        in the result.
        Carefully review which records appear in the left join result, but not in the inner join result.
