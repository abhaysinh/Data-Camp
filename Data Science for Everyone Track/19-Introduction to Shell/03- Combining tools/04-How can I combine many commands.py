How can I combine many commands?

You can chain any number of commands together. For example, this command:

cut -d , -f 1 seasonal/spring.csv | grep -v Date | head -n 10

will:

    select the first column from the spring data;
    remove the header line containing the word "Date"; and
    select the first 10 lines of actual data.

    In the previous exercise, you used the following command to select all the tooth names from column 2 of seasonal/summer.csv:

        cut -d , -f 2 seasonal/summer.csv | grep -v Tooth

    Extend this pipeline with a head command to only select the very first tooth name.

Solution :

cut -d , -f 2 seasonal/summer.csv | grep -v Tooth | head -n 1
