Plot a CDF

The distribution of income in almost every country is long-tailed; that is, there are a small
number of people with very high incomes.

In the GSS dataset, the variable 'realinc' represents total household income, converted to 1986 dollars.
We can get a sense of the shape of this distribution by plotting the CDF.

    Select 'realinc' from the gss dataset.
    Make a Cdf object called cdf_income.
    Create a plot of cdf_income using .plot().

'''

# Select realinc
income = gss['realinc']

# Make the CDF
cdf_income = Cdf(income)

# Plot it
cdf_income.plot()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Income (1986 USD)')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.show()
