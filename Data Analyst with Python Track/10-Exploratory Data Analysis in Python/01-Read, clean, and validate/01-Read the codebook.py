Read the codebook

When you work with datasets like the NSFG, it is important to read the documentation carefully. If you interpret a variable incorrectly, you can generate nonsense results and never realize it. So, before we start coding, I want to make sure you are familiar with the NSFG codebook, which describes every variable.

    Follow this link (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsradmin/nsfg/index?studyNumber=9999) to get to the interactive codebook.

    Type "birthweight" in the search field, UNSELECT the checkbox that says "Search variable name only", and press "Search". You should see a list of variables related to birthweight.

    Click on "BIRTHWGT_OZ1" and read the documentation of this variable. For your convenience, it is also displayed here:
