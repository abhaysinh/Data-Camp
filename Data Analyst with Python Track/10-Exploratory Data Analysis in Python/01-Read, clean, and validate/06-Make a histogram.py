Make a histogram

Histograms are one of the most useful tools in exploratory data analysis.
They quickly give you an overview of the distribution of a variable, that is, what values the variable can have,
and how many times each value appears.

As we saw in a previous exercise, the NSFG dataset includes a variable 'agecon' that records age at conception
for each pregnancy. Here, you're going to plot a histogram of this variable. You'll use the bins parameter
that you saw in the video, and also a new parameter - histtype - which you can read more about here in the
matplotlib documentation. Learning how to read documentation is an essential skill. If you want to learn more
about matplotlib, you can check out DataCamp's Introduction to Matplotlib course.

Instructions

    1   Plot a histogram of agecon with 20 bins.    - 50 XP

    2   Adapt your code to make an unfilled histogram by setting the parameter histtype to be 'step'.   - 50 XP

'''


# Plot the histogram
plt.hist(agecon, bins = 20)

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age at conception')
plt.ylabel('Number of pregnancies')

# Show the figure
plt.show()


# Plot the histogram
plt.hist(agecon, bins=20, histtype='step')

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age at conception')
plt.ylabel('Number of pregnancies')

# Show the figure
plt.show()
