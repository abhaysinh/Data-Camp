Distribution of income

In the next two exercises we'll look at relationships between income and other variables.
In the BRFSS, income is represented as a categorical variable; that is, respondents are assigned to
one of 8 income categories. The variable name is 'INCOME2'. Before we connect income with anything else,
let's look at the distribution by computing the PMF. Recall that all Pmf objects have a .bar() method.

    Extract 'INCOME2' from the brfss DataFrame and assign it to income.
    Plot the PMF of income as a bar chart.

# Extract income
income = brfss['INCOME2']

# Plot the PMF
Pmf(income).bar()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Income level')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
