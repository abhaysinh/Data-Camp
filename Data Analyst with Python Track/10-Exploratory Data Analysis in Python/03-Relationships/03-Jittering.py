Jittering

In the previous exercise, the ages fall in columns because they've been rounded into 5-year bins.
If we jitter them, the scatter plot will show the relationship more clearly. Recall how Allen jittered height
and weight in the video:

height_jitter = height + np.random.normal(0, 2, size=len(brfss))
weight_jitter = weight + np.random.normal(0, 2, size=len(brfss))

Instructions
100 XP

    Add random noise to age with mean 0 and standard deviation 2.5.
    Make a scatter plot between weight and age with marker size 5 and alpha=0.2. Be sure to also specify 'o'.

# Select the first 1000 respondents
brfss = brfss[:1000]

# Add jittering to age
age = brfss['AGE'] + np.random.normal(0, 2.5, size=len(brfss))
# Extract weight
weight = brfss['WTKG3']

# Make a scatter plot
plt.plot(age, weight, 'o', markersize=5, alpha=0.2)

plt.xlabel('Age in years')
plt.ylabel('Weight in kg')
plt.show()
