Fit a line

Continuing from the previous exercise:

    Assume that xs and ys contain income codes and daily vegetable consumption, respectively, and

    res contains the results of a simple linear regression of ys onto xs.

Now, you're going to compute the line of best fit. NumPy has been imported for you as np.

    Set fx to the minimum and maximum of xs, stored in a NumPy array.
    Set fy to the points on the fitted line that correspond to the fx.

# Plot the scatter plot
plt.clf()
x_jitter = xs + np.random.normal(0, 0.15, len(xs))
plt.plot(x_jitter, ys, 'o', alpha=0.2)

# Plot the line of best fit
fx = np.array([xs.min(), xs.max()])
fy = res.intercept + res.slope * fx
plt.plot(fx, fy, '-', alpha=0.7)

plt.xlabel('Income code')
plt.ylabel('Vegetable servings per day')
plt.ylim([0, 6])
plt.show()
