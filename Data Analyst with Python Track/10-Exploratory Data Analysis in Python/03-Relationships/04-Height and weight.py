Height and weight

Previously we looked at a scatter plot of height and weight, and saw that taller people tend to be heavier.
Now let's take a closer look using a box plot. The brfss DataFrame contains a variable '_HTMG10' that represents
height in centimeters, binned into 10 cm groups.

Recall how Allen created the box plot of 'AGE' and 'WTKG3' in the video, with the y-axis on a logarithmic scale:

sns.boxplot(x='AGE', y='WTKG3', data=data, whis=10)
plt.yscale('log')

Instructions

    Fill in the parameters of .boxplot() to plot the distribution of weight ('WTKG3') in each height ('_HTMG10') group.
    Specify whis=10, just as was done in the video.
    Add a line to plot the y-axis on a logarithmic scale.

# Drop rows with missing data
data = brfss.dropna(subset=['_HTMG10', 'WTKG3'])

# Make a box plot
sns.boxplot(x='_HTMG10', y='WTKG3', data=data, whis=10)

# Plot the y-axis on a log scale
plt.yscale('log')

# Remove unneeded lines and label axes
sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)
plt.xlabel('Height in cm')
plt.ylabel('Weight in kg')
plt.show()
