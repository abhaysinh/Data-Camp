Making predictions

At this point, we have a model that predicts income using age, education, and sex.

Let's see what it predicts for different levels of education, holding age constant.

Instructions

    Using np.linspace(), add a variable named 'educ' to df with a range of values from 0 to 20.
    Add a variable named 'age' with the constant value 30.
    Use df to generate predicted income as a function of education.

'''

# Run a regression model with educ, educ2, age, and age2
results = smf.ols('realinc ~ educ + educ2 + age + age2', data=gss).fit()

# Make the DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame()
df['educ'] = np.linspace(0, 20)
df['age'] = 30
df['educ2'] = df['educ']**2
df['age2'] = df['age']**2

# Generate and plot the predictions
pred = results.predict(df)
print(pred.head())
