Self-join

In this exercise, you'll use the populations table to perform a self-join to calculate the percentage increase in population from 2010 to 2015 for each country code!

Since you'll be joining the populations table to itself, you can alias populations as p1 and also populations as p2. This is good practice whenever you are aliasing and your tables have the same first letter. Note that you are required to alias the tables with self-joins.

    1   Join populations with itself ON country_code.
        Select the country_code from p1 and the size field from both p1 and p2. SQL won't allow same-named fields,
        so alias p1.size as size2010 and p2.size as size2015.

    2   Notice from the result that for each country_code you have four entries laying out all combinations of 2010 and 2015.

        Extend the ON in your query to include only those records where the p1.year (2010) matches with p2.year
        - 5 (2015 - 5 = 2010). This will omit the three entries per country_code that you aren't interested in.

    3   As you just saw, you can also use SQL to calculate values like p2.year - 5 for you. With two fields like
        size2010 and size2015, you may want to determine the percentage increase from one field to the next:

        With two numeric fields A and B, the percentage growth from A to B can be calculated as (B−A)/A∗100.0.
        Add a new field to SELECT, aliased as growth_perc,
        that calculates the percentage population growth from 2010 to 2015 for each country, using p2.size and p1.size.
