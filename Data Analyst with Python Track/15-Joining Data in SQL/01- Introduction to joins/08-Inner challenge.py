Inner challenge

The table you created with the added geosize_group field has been loaded for you here with the name countries_plus. Observe the use of (and the placement of) the INTO command to create this countries_plus table:

SELECT name, continent, code, surface_area,
    CASE WHEN surface_area > 2000000
            THEN 'large'
       WHEN surface_area > 350000
            THEN 'medium'
       ELSE 'small' END
       AS geosize_group
INTO countries_plus
FROM countries;

You will now explore the relationship between the size of a country in terms of surface area and in terms of population using grouping fields created with CASE.

By the end of this exercise, you'll be writing two queries back-to-back in a single script. You got this!

Instructions
100 XP

    1   Using the populations table focused only for the year 2015, create a new field aliased as popsize_group to
        organize population size into

        'large' (> 50 million),
        'medium' (> 1 million), and
        'small' groups.

        Select only the country code, population size, and this new popsize_group as fields.


    2   Use INTO to save the result of the previous query as pop_plus. You can see an example of this in the
        countries_plus code in the assignment text. Make sure to include a ; at the end of your WHERE clause!

        Then, include another query below your first query to display all the records in pop_plus using
        SELECT * FROM pop_plus; so that you generate results and this will display pop_plus in query result.

    3   Keep the first query intact that creates pop_plus using INTO.
        Write a query to join countries_plus AS c on the left with pop_plus AS p on the right matching on the country code fields.
        Sort the data based on geosize_group, in ascending order so that large appears on top.
        Select the name, continent, geosize_group, and popsize_group fields.
