Union all

As you saw, duplicates were removed from the previous two exercises by using UNION.

To include duplicates, you can use UNION ALL.

Instructions
100 XP

    Determine all combinations (include duplicates) of country code and year that exist in either the economies or the populations tables. Order by code then year.
    The result of the query should only have two columns/fields. Think about how many records this query should result in.
    You'll use code very similar to this in your next exercise after the video. Make note of this code after completing it.
