Relating semi-join to a tweaked inner join

Let's revisit the code from the previous exercise, which retrieves languages spoken in the Middle East.

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM languages
WHERE code IN
  (SELECT code
   FROM countries
   WHERE region = 'Middle East')
ORDER BY name;

Sometimes problems solved with semi-joins can also be solved using an inner join.

SELECT languages.name AS language
FROM languages
INNER JOIN countries
ON languages.code = countries.code
WHERE region = 'Middle East'
ORDER BY language;

This inner join isn't quite right. What is missing from this second code block to get it to match with the correct answer produced by the first block?
