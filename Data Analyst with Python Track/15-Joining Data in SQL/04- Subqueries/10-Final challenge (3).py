Final challenge (3)

Welcome to the last challenge problem. By now you're a query warrior! Remember that these challenges are designed to take you to the limit to solidify your SQL knowledge! Take a deep breath and solve this step-by-step.

You are now tasked with determining the top 10 capital cities in Europe and the Americas in terms of a calculated percentage using city_proper_pop and metroarea_pop in cities.

Do not use table aliasing in this exercise.

Instructions
100 XP

    Select the city name, country code, city proper population, and metro area population.
    Calculate the percentage of metro area population composed of city proper population for each city in cities, aliased as city_perc.
    Focus only on capital cities in Europe and the Americas in a subquery.
    Make sure to exclude records with missing data on metro area population.
    Order the result by city_perc descending.
    Then determine the top 10 capital cities in Europe and the Americas in terms of this city_perc percentage.
