Adding new columns

You aren't stuck with just the data you are given. Instead, you can add new columns to a DataFrame. This has many names, such as transforming, mutating, and feature engineering.

You can create new columns from scratch, but it is also common to derive them from other columns, for example, by adding columns together, or by changing their units.

homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

    Add a new column to homelessness, named total, containing the sum of the individuals and family_members columns.
    Add another column to homelessness, named p_individuals, containing the proportion of homeless people in each state who are individuals.

# Add total col as sum of individuals and family_members
homelessness["total"] = homelessness["individuals"] + homelessness["family_members"]

# Add p_individuals col as proportion of individuals
homelessness["p_individuals"] = homelessness["individuals"] / homelessness["total"]

# See the result
print(homelessness)
