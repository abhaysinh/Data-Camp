Sorting rows

Finding interested bits of data in a DataFrame is often easier if you change the order of the rows. You can sort the rows by passing a column name to .sort_values().

In cases where rows have the same value (this is common if you sort on a categorical variable), you may wish to break the ties by sorting on another column. You can sort on multiple columns in this way by passing a list of column names.
Sort on ... 	Syntax
one column 	df.sort_values("breed")
multiple columns 	df.sort_values(["breed", "weight_kg"])

By combining .sort_values() with .head(), you can answer questions in the form, "What are the top cases where...?".

    Sort homelessness by the number of homeless individuals, from smallest to largest, and save this as homelessness_ind.
    Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.

    Sort homelessness by the number of homeless family members in descending order, and save this as homelessness_fam.
    Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.

    Sort homelessness first by region (ascending), and then by number of family members (descending). Save this as homelessness_reg_fam.
    Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.
