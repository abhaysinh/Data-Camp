Slicing in both directions

You've seen slicing DataFrames by rows and by columns, but since DataFrames are two dimensional objects it is often natural to slice both dimensions at once. That is, by passing two arguments to .loc[], you can subset by rows and columns in one go.

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_srt is indexed by country and city, has a sorted index, and is available.

# Subset rows from India, Hyderabad to Iraq, Baghdad
print(temperatures_srt.loc[("India", "Hyderabad"):("Iraq", "Baghdad")])

# Subset columns from date to avg_temp_c
print(temperatures_srt.loc[:, "date":"avg_temp_c"])

# Subset in both directions at once
print(temperatures_srt.loc[("India", "Hyderabad"):("Iraq", "Baghdad"), "date":"avg_temp_c"])
