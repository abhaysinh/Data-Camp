Connect to a database

In order to get data from a database with pandas, you first need to be able to connect to one. In this exercise, you'll practice creating a database engine to manage connections to a database, data.db. To do this, you'll use sqlalchemy's create_engine() function.

create_engine() needs a string URL to the database. For SQLite databases, that string consists of "sqlite:///", then the database file name.

# Create the database engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///data.db")

# View the tables in the database
print(engine.table_names())
