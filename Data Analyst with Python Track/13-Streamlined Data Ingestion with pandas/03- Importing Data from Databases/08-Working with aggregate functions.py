Working with aggregate functions

If a table contains data with higher granularity than is needed for an analysis, it can make sense to summarize the data with SQL aggregate functions before importing it. For example, if you have data of flood event counts by month but precipitation data by day, you may decide to SUM precipitation by month.

The weather table contains daily readings for four months. In this exercise, you'll practice summarizing weather by month with the MAX, MIN, and SUM functions.

pandas has been loaded as pd, and a database engine, engine, has been created.

    1   Create a query to pass to read_sql() that will get months and the MAX value of tmax by monthfrom weather.

    2   Modify the query to also get the MIN tmin value for each month.

    3   Modify the query to also get the total precipitation (prcp) for each month.
