loc and iloc (3)

It's also possible to select only columns with loc and iloc. In both cases, you simply put a slice going from beginning to end in front of the comma:

cars.loc[:, 'country']
cars.iloc[:, 1]

cars.loc[:, ['country','drives_right']]
cars.iloc[:, [1, 2]]

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out drives_right column as Series
print(cars.loc[:,'drives_right'])
print(cars.iloc[:, 2])

# Print out drives_right column as DataFrame
print(cars.loc[:,['drives_right']])
print(cars.iloc[:,[2]])

# Print out cars_per_cap and drives_right as DataFrame
print(cars.loc[:,['cars_per_cap', 'drives_right']])
cars.iloc[:, [1, 2]]
