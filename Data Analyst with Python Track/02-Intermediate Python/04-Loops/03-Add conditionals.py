Add conditionals

The while loop that corrects the offset is a good start, but what if offset is negative? You can try to run the following code where offset is initialized to -6:

# Initialize offset
offset = -6

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    offset = offset - 1
    print(offset)

but your session will be disconnected. The while loop will never stop running, because offset will be further decreased on every run. offset != 0 will never become False and the while loop continues forever.

Fix things by putting an if-else statement inside the while loop. If your code is still taking too long to run, you probably made a mistake!

    Inside the while loop, complete the if-else statement:
        If offset is greater than zero, you should decrease offset by 1.
        Else, you should increase offset by 1.
    If you've coded things correctly, hitting Submit Answer should work this time.

If your code is still taking too long to run (or your session is expiring), you probably made a mistake. Check your code and make sure that the statement offset != 0 will eventually evaluate to FALSE!
