Creating strings

Let's continue to fill out the Missing Puppy Report for Bayes. In the previous exercise, we defined bayes_age, which was a float, which represents a number.

In this exercise, we'll define favorite_toy and owner, which will both be strings. A string represents text. A string is surrounded by quotation marks (' or ") and can contain letters, numbers, and special characters. It doesn't matter if you use single (') or double (") quotes, but it's important to be consistent throughout your code.
