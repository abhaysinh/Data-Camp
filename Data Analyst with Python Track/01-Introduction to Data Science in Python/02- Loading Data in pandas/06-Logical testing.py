Logical testing

Let's practice writing logical statements and displaying the output.

Recall that we use the following operators:

    == tests that two values are equal.
    != tests that two values are not equal.
    > and < test that greater than or less than, respectively.
    >= and <= test greater than or equal to or less than or equal to, respectively.

    1   The variable height_inches represents the height of a suspect. Is height_inches greater than 70 inches?

    2   The variable plate1 represents a license plate number of a suspect. Is it equal to FRQ123?

    3   The variable fur_color represents the color of Bayes' fur. Check that fur_color is not equal to "brown".

# Is height_inches greater than 70 inches?
print(height_inches > 70)

# Is plate1 equal to "FRQ123"?
print(plate1 == "FRQ123")

# Is fur_color not equal to "brown"?
print(fur_color != "brown")
