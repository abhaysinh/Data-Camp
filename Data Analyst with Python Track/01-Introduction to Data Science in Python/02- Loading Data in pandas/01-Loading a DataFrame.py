We're still working hard to solve the kidnapping of Bayes, the Golden Retriever. Previously, we used a license
plate spotted at the crime scene to narrow the list of suspects to:

    Fred Frequentist
    Ronald Aylmer Fisher
    Gertrude Cox
    Kirstine Smith

We've obtained credit card records for all four suspects. Perhaps some of them made suspicious purchases before the kidnapping?

The records are in a CSV called "credit_records.csv".

Instructions

    Import the pandas module under the alias pd.
    Load the CSV "credit_records.csv" into a DataFrame called credit_records.
    Display the first five rows of credit_records using the .head() method.
