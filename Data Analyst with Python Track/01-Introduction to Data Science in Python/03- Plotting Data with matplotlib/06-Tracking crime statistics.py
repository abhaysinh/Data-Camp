Tracking crime statistics

Sergeant Laura wants to do some background research to help her better understand the cultural context
for Bayes' kidnapping. She has plotted Burglary rates in three U.S. cities using data from the Uniform
Crime Reporting Statistics. (https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/LocalCrimeLarge.cfm)

She wants to present this data to her officers, and she wants the image to be as beautiful as possible to
effectively tell her data story.

Recall:

    You can change linestyle to dotted (':'), dashed('--'), or no line ('').
    You can change the marker to circle ('o'), diamond('d'), or square ('s').
