Charting cellphone data

We know that Freddy Frequentist is the one who kidnapped Bayes the Golden Retriever.

Our friends at the police station have acquired cell phone data, which gives some of Freddie's
locations over the past three weeks. It's stored in the DataFrame cellphone. The x-coordinates are in the
column 'x' and the y-coordinates are in the column 'y'.
