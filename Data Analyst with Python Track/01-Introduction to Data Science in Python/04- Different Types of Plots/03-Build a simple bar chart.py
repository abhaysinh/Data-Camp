Build a simple bar chart

Officer Deshaun wants to plot the average number of hours worked per week for him and his coworkers.
He has stored the hours worked in a DataFrame called hours, which has columns officer and avg_hours_worked.
Recall that the function plt.bar() takes two arguments: the labels for each bar, and the height of each bar.
Both of these can be found in our DataFrame.

    1   Display the DataFrame hours using a print command.

    2   Create a bar chart of the column avg_hours_worked for each officer from the DataFrame hours.

    3   Use the column std_hours_worked (the standard deviation of the hours worked) to add error bars to the bar chart.

# Display the DataFrame hours using print
print(hours)



# Create a bar plot from the DataFrame hours
plt.bar(hours.officer, hours.avg_hours_worked)

# Display the plot
plt.show()




# Display the DataFrame hours using print
print(hours)

# Create a bar plot from the DataFrame hours
plt.bar(hours.officer, hours.avg_hours_worked,
        # Add error bars
        yerr=hours.std_hours_worked)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
