Selecting from a multi-indexed Series

The output of a single .groupby() operation on multiple columns is a Series with a MultiIndex.
Working with this type of object is similar to working with a DataFrame:

    The outer index level is like the DataFrame rows.
    The inner index level is like the DataFrame columns.

In this exercise, you'll practice accessing data from a multi-indexed Series using the .loc[] accessor.
Instructions
100 XP

    Save the output of the .groupby() operation from the last exercise as a new object, arrest_rate.
    (This has been done for you.)
    Print the arrest_rate Series and examine it.
    Print the arrest rate for moving violations in bad weather.
    Print the arrest rates for speeding violations in all three weather conditions.

# Save the output of the groupby operation from the last exercise
arrest_rate = ri_weather.groupby(['violation', 'rating']).is_arrested.mean()

# Print the 'arrest_rate' Series
print(arrest_rate)

# Print the arrest rate for moving violations in bad weather
print(arrest_rate.loc['Moving violation', 'bad'])

# Print the arrest rates for speeding violations in all three weather conditions
print(arrest_rate.loc['Speeding'])
