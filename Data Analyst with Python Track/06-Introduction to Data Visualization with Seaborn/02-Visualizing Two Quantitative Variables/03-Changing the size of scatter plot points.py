Changing the size of scatter plot points

In this exercise, we'll explore Seaborn's mpg dataset, which contains one row per car model and includes
information such as the year the car was made, the number of miles per gallon ("M.P.G.") it achieves,
the power of its engine (measured in "horsepower"), and its country of origin.

What is the relationship between the power of a car's engine ("horsepower") and its fuel efficiency ("mpg")?
And how does this relationship vary by the number of cylinders ("cylinders") the car has? Let's find out.

Let's continue to use relplot() instead of scatterplot() since it offers more flexibility.

Instructions


    1 Use relplot() and the mpg DataFrame to create a scatter plot with "horsepower" on the x-axis and
    "mpg" on the y-axis. Vary the size of the points by the number of cylinders in the car ("cylinders"). 50 XP

    2 vTo make this plot easier to read, use hue to vary the color of the points by the number of
    cylinders in the car ("cylinders"). 50 XP
