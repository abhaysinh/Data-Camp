Bar plots with percentages

Let's continue exploring the responses to a survey sent out to young people.
The variable "Interested in Math" is True if the person reported being interested or very interested in mathematics,
and False otherwise. What percentage of young people report being interested in math, and does this vary based on
gender? Let's use a bar plot to find out.

As a reminder, we'll create a bar plot using the catplot() function, providing the name of categorical variable
to put on the x-axis (x=____), the name of the quantitative variable to summarize on the y-axis (y=____), the Pandas
DataFrame to use (data=____), and the type of categorical plot (kind="bar").

Seaborn has been imported as sns and matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt.
