Point plots with subgroups

Let's continue exploring the dataset of students in secondary school. This time, we'll ask the question:
is being in a romantic relationship associated with higher or lower school attendance? And does this association
differ by which school the students attend? Let's find out using a point plot.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

Instructions


    1 Use sns.catplot() and the student_data DataFrame to create a point plot with relationship status ("romantic")
    on the x-axis and number of absences ("absences") on the y-axis. Create subgroups based on the school that they
    attend ("school") - 35 XP

    2 Turn off the confidence intervals for the plot. 35 XP

    3 Since there may be outliers of students with many absences, import the median function from numpy and
    display the median number of absences instead of the average. 30 XP
