Adding a title to a FacetGrid object

In the previous exercise, we used relplot() with the miles per gallon dataset to create a scatter plot showing
the relationship between a car's weight and its horsepower. This created a FacetGrid object. Now that we know what
type of object it is, let's add a title to this plot.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

    Add the following title to this plot: "Car Weight vs. Horsepower".

# Create scatter plot
g = sns.relplot(x="weight",
                y="horsepower",
                data=mpg,
                kind="scatter")

# Add a title "Car Weight vs. Horsepower"
g.fig.suptitle("Car Weight vs. Horsepower")

# Show plot
plt.show()
