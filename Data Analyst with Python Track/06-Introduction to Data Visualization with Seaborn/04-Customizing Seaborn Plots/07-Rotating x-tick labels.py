'''
Rotating x-tick labels

In this exercise, we'll continue looking at the miles per gallon dataset. In the code provided,
we create a point plot that displays the average acceleration for cars in each of the three places of origin.
Note that the "acceleration" variable is the time to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour, in seconds.
Higher values indicate slower acceleration.

Let's use this plot to practice rotating the x-tick labels. Recall that the function to rotate x-tick labels
is a standalone Matplotlib function and not a function applied to the plot object itself.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

    Rotate the x-tick labels 90 degrees.

# Create point plot
sns.catplot(x="origin",
            y="acceleration",
            data=mpg,
            kind="point",
            join=False,
            capsize=0.1)

# Rotate x-tick labels
plt.xticks(rotation=90)

# Show plot
plt.show()
