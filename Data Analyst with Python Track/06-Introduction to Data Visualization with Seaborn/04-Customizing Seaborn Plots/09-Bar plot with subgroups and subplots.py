Bar plot with subgroups and subplots

In this exercise, we'll return to our young people survey dataset and investigate whether the proportion
of people who like techno music ("Likes Techno") varies by their gender ("Gender") or where they live
("Village - town"). This exercise will give us an opportunity to practice the many things we've learned throughout this course!

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

Instructions

    Set the figure style to "dark".
    Adjust the bar plot code to add subplots based on "Gender", arranged in columns.
    Add the title "Percentage of Young People Who Like Techno" to this FacetGrid plot.
    Label the x-axis "Location of Residence" and y-axis "% Who Like Techno".
