Using a custom palette

So far, we've looked at several things in the dataset of survey responses from young people,
including their internet usage, how often they listen to their parents, and how many of them report feeling lonely.
However, one thing we haven't done is a basic summary of the type of people answering this survey, including their
age and gender. Providing these basic summaries is always a good practice when dealing with an unfamiliar dataset.

The code provided will create a box plot showing the distribution of ages for male versus female respondents.
Let's adjust the code to customize the appearance, this time using a custom color palette.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

# Set the style to "darkgrid"
sns.set_style("darkgrid")

# Set a custom color palette
sns.set_palette(["#39A7D0", "#36ADA4"])

# Create the box plot of age distribution by gender
sns.catplot(x="Gender", y="Age",
            data=survey_data, kind="box")

# Show plot
plt.show()
