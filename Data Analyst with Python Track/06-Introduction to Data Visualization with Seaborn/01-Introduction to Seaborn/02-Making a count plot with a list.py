Making a count plot with a list

In the last exercise, we explored a dataset that contains information about 227 countries.
Let's do more exploration of this data - specifically, how many countries are in each region of the world?

To do this, we'll need to use a count plot. Count plots take in a categorical list and return bars that represent
the number of list entries per category. You can create one here using a list of regions for each country, which is
a variable named region.
