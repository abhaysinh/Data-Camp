Aggregate functions

Often, you will want to perform some calculation on the data in a database. SQL provides a few functions, called aggregate functions, to help you out with this.

For example,

SELECT AVG(budget)
FROM films;

gives you the average value from the budget column of the films table. Similarly, the MAX function returns the highest budget:

SELECT MAX(budget)
FROM films;

The SUM function returns the result of adding up the numeric values in a column:

SELECT SUM(budget)
FROM films;

You can probably guess what the MIN function does! Now it's your turn to try out some SQL functions.
