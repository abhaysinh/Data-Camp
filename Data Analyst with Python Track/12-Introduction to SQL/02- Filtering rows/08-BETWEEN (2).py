BETWEEN (2)

Similar to the WHERE clause, the BETWEEN clause can be used with multiple AND and OR operators, so you can build up your queries and make them even more powerful!

For example, suppose we have a table called kids. We can get the names of all kids between the ages of 2 and 12 from the United States:

SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age BETWEEN 2 AND 12
AND nationality = 'USA';

Take a go at using BETWEEN with AND on the films data to get the title and release year of all Spanish language films released between 1990 and 2000 (inclusive) with budgets over $100 million. We have broken the problem into smaller steps so that you can build the query as you go along!

Instructions
100 XP

        Get the title and release year of all films released between 1990 and 2000 (inclusive).

        Now, build on your previous query to select only films that have budgets over $100 million.

        Now restrict the query to only return Spanish language films.

        Finally, modify to your previous query to include all Spanish language or French language films with the
            same criteria as before. Don't forget your parentheses!
