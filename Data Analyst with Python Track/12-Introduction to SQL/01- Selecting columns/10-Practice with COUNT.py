Practice with COUNT

As you've seen, COUNT(*) tells you how many rows are in a table. However, if you want to count the number of non-missing values in a particular column, you can call COUNT on just that column.

For example, to count the number of birth dates present in the people table:

SELECT COUNT(birthdate)
FROM people;

It's also common to combine COUNT with DISTINCT to count the number of distinct values in a column.

For example, this query counts the number of distinct birth dates contained in the people table:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT birthdate)
FROM people;

Let's get some practice with COUNT!
