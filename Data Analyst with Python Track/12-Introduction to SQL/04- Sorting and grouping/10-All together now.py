All together now

Time to practice using ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING together.

Now you're going to write a query that returns the average budget and average gross earnings for films in each year after 1990, if the average budget is greater than $60 million.

This is going to be a big query, but you can handle it!
Instructions
100 XP

        Get the release year, budget and gross earnings for each film in the films table.

        Modify your query so that only records with a release_year after 1990 are included.

        Remove the budget and gross columns, and group your results by release year.

        Modify your query to include the average budget and average gross earnings for the results you have so far.
            Alias the average budget as avg_budget; alias the average gross earnings as avg_gross.

        Modify your query so that only years with an average budget of greater than $60 million are included.

        Finally, modify your query to order the results from highest average gross earnings to lowest.
