HAVING a great time

In SQL, aggregate functions can't be used in WHERE clauses. For example, the following query is invalid:

SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
WHERE COUNT(title) > 10;

This means that if you want to filter based on the result of an aggregate function, you need another way! That's where the HAVING clause comes in. For example,

SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10;

shows only those years in which more than 10 films were released.

In how many different years were more than 200 movies released?
