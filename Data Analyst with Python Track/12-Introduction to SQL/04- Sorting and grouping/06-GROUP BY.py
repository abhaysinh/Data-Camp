GROUP BY

Now you know how to sort results! Often you'll need to aggregate results. For example, you might want to count the number of male and female employees in your company. Here, what you want is to group all the males together and count them, and group all the females together and count them. In SQL, GROUP BY allows you to group a result by one or more columns, like so:

SELECT sex, count(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY sex;

This might give, for example:
sex 	count
male 	15
female 	19


Commonly, GROUP BY is used with aggregate functions like COUNT() or MAX(). Note that GROUP BY always goes after the FROM clause!
