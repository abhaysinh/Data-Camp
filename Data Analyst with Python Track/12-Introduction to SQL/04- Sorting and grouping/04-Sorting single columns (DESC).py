Sorting single columns (DESC)

To order results in descending order, you can put the keyword DESC after your ORDER BY. For example, to get all the names in the people table, in reverse alphabetical order:

SELECT name
FROM people
ORDER BY name DESC;

Now practice using ORDER BY with DESC to sort single columns in descending order!
