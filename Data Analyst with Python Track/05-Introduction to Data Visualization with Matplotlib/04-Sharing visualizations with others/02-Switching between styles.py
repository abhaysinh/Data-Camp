Switching between styles

Selecting a style to use affects all of the visualizations that are created after this style is selected.

Here, you will practice plotting data in two different styles. The data you will use is the same weather data
we used in the first lesson: you will have available to you the DataFrame seattle_weather and the DataFrame
austin_weather, both with records of the average temperature in every month.

    2 Select the 'Solarize_Light2' style, create a new Figure called fig, and a new Axes object called ax with plt.subplots.

# Use the "ggplot" style and create new Figure/Axes
plt.style.use('ggplot')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"])
plt.show()


# Use the "Solarize_Light2" style and create new Figure/Axes
plt.style.use('Solarize_Light2')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"])
plt.show()
