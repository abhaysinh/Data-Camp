Encoding time by color

The screen only has two dimensions, but we can encode another dimension in the scatter plot using color.
Here, we will visualize the climate_change dataset, plotting a scatter plot of the "co2" column, on the x-axis,
against the "relative_temp" column, on the y-axis. We will encode time using the color dimension,
with earlier times appearing as darker shades of blue and later times appearing as brighter shades of yellow.

    Using the ax.scatter method add a scatter plot of the "co2" column (x-axis) against the "relative_temp" column.
    Use the c key-word argument to pass in the index of the DataFrame as input to color each point according to its date.
    Set the x-axis label to "CO2 (ppm)" and the y-axis label to "Relative temperature (C)".

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add data: "co2", "relative_temp" as x-y, index as color
ax.scatter(climate_change["co2"], climate_change["relative_temp"], c=climate_change.index)

# Set the x-axis label to "CO2 (ppm)"
ax.set_xlabel("CO2 (ppm)")

# Set the y-axis label to "Relative temperature (C)"
ax.set_ylabel("Relative temperature (C)")
