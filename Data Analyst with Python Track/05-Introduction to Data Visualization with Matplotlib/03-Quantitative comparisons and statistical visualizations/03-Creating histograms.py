Creating histograms

Histograms show the full distribution of a variable. In this exercise, we will display the distribution of
weights of medalists in gymnastics and in rowing in the 2016 Olympic games for a comparison between them.

You will have two DataFrames to use. The first is called mens_rowing and includes information about the medalists
in the men's rowing events. The other is called mens_gymnastics and includes information about medalists in all of
the Gymnastics events.

    Use the ax.hist method to add a histogram of the "Weight" column from the mens_rowing DataFrame.
    Use ax.hist to add a histogram of "Weight" for the mens_gymnastics DataFrame.
    Set the x-axis label to "Weight (kg)" and the y-axis label to "# of observations".

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
# Plot a histogram of "Weight" for mens_rowing
ax.hist(mens_rowing["Weight"])

# Compare to histogram of "Weight" for mens_gymnastics
ax.hist(mens_gymnastics["Weight"])

# Set the x-axis label to "Weight (kg)"
ax.set_xlabel("Weight (kg)")

# Set the y-axis label to "# of observations"
ax.set_ylabel("# of observations")

plt.show()
