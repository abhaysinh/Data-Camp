Simple scatter plot

Scatter are a bi-variate visualization technique. They plot each record in the data as a point.
The location of each point is determined by the value of two variables: the first variable determines the distance
along the x-axis and the second variable determines the height along the y-axis.

In this exercise, you will create a scatter plot of the climate_change data.
This DataFrame, which is already loaded, has a column "co2" that indicates the measurements of carbon dioxide
every month and another column, "relative_temp" that indicates the temperature measured at the same time.

    Using the ax.scatter method, add the data to the plot: "co2" on the x-axis and "relative_temp" on the y-axis.
    Set the x-axis label to "CO2 (ppm)".
    Set the y-axis label to "Relative temperature (C)".

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add data: "co2" on x-axis, "relative_temp" on y-axis
ax.scatter(climate_change["co2"], climate_change["relative_temp"])

# Set the x-axis label to "CO2 (ppm)"
ax.set_xlabel("CO2 (ppm)")

# Set the y-axis label to "Relative temperature (C)"
ax.set_ylabel("Relative temperature (C)")

plt.show()
