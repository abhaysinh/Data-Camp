Customizing axis labels and adding titles

Customizing the axis labels requires using the set_xlabel and set_ylabel methods of the Axes object.
Adding a title uses the set_title method.

In this exercise, you will customize the content of the axis labels and add a title to a plot.

As before, the data is already provided in Pandas DataFrame objects loaded into memory: seattle_weather and
austin_weather. These each have a MONTH column and a MLY-PRCP-NORMAL column. These data are plotted against
each other in the first two lines of the sample code provided.

In addition, a Figure object named fig and an Axes object named ax have already been created for you.

    Use the set_xlabel method to add the label: "Time (months)".
    Use the set_ylabel method to add the label: "Precipitation (inches)".
    Use the set_title method to add the title: "Weather patterns in Austin and Seattle".

ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])
ax.plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])

# Customize the x-axis label
ax.set_xlabel("Time (months)")

# Customize the y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel("Precipitation (inches)")

# Add the title
ax.set_title("Weather patterns in Austin and Seattle")

# Display the figure
plt.show()
