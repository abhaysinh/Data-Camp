Using the matplotlib.pyplot interface

There are many ways to use Matplotlib. In this course, we will focus on the pyplot interface, which provides the
most flexibility in creating and customizing data visualizations.

Initially, we will use the pyplot interface to create two kinds of objects: Figure objects and Axes objects.

This course introduces a lot of new concepts, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the Matplotlib Cheat
