Tweet classification: Trump vs. Trudeau\n","<p>So you think you can classify text? How about tweets?

There are also plenty of platform-specific conventions to give you hassles: mentions, #hashtags, emoji, links and short-hand phrases (ikr?). Can we overcome those challenges and build a useful classifier for these two tweeters? Yes! Let's get started.</p>\n","<p>To begin, we will import all the tools we need from scikit-learn. We will need to properly vectorize our data (<code>CountVectorizer</code> and <code>TfidfVectorizer</code>). And we will also want to import some models, including <code>MultinomialNB</code> from the <code>naive_bayes</code> module, <code>LinearSVC</code> from the <code>svm</code> module and <code>PassiveAggressiveClassifier</code> from the <code>linear_model</code> module.
