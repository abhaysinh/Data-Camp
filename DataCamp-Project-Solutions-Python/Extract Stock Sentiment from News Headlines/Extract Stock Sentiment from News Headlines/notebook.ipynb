Searching for gold inside HTML files\n<p>It used to take days for financial news to spread via radio, newspapers, and word of mouth. Now, in the age of the internet, it takes seconds. Did you know news articles are <em>automatically</em> being generated from figures and earnings call streams? Hedge funds and independent traders are using data science to process this wealth of information in the quest for profit.</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we will generate investing insight by applying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis\">sentiment analysis</a> on financial news headlines from <a href=\"https://finviz.com\">FINVIZ.com</a>. Using this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing\">natural language processing</a> technique, we can understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market <em>feels</em> good or bad about a stock. It would then be possible to make educated guesses on how certain stocks will perform and trade accordingly.
