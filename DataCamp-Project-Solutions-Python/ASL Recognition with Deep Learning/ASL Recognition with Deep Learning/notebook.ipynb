American Sign Language (ASL)\n<p>American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals.

This technology  often relies on complex neural network architectures that can detect subtle patterns in streaming video.
