Introduced in 2015 to all 30 major league ballparks, Statcast data is revolutionizing the game. Teams are engaging in an \"arms race\" of data analysis, hiring analysts left and right in an attempt to gain an edge over their competition. This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rOKGKhQe8U\">video</a> describing the system is incredible.</p>\n<p><strong>In this notebook</strong>, we're going to wrangle, analyze, and visualize Statcast data to compare Mr. Judge and another (extremely large) teammate of his. Let's start by loading the data into our Notebook. There are two CSV files, <code>judge.csv</code> and <code>stanton.csv</code>, both of which contain Statcast data for 2015-2017.

Statcast <em>does</em> track pitch movement and type but let's move on to something else: <strong>pitch location</strong>. Statcast tracks the zone the pitch is in when it crosses the plate.
