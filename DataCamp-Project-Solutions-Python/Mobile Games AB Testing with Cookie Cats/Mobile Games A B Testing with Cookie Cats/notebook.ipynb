Of cats and cookies\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cookiecatsgame\">Cookie Cats</a> is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by <a href=\"http://tactile.dk\">Tactile Entertainment</a>. It's a classic \"connect three\"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. We're not kidding!

The conclusion\n<p>The bootstrap result tells us that there is strong evidence that 7-day retention is higher when the gate is at level 30 than when it is at level 40. The conclusion is: If we want to keep retention high — both 1-day and 7-day retention — we should <strong>not</strong> move the gate from level 30 to level 40. There are, of course, other metrics we could look at, like the number of game rounds played or how much in-game purchases are made by the two AB-groups. But retention <em>is</em> one of the most important metrics. If we don't retain our player base, it doesn't matter how much money they spend in-game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/project_184/img/cookie_yellow.png\" style=\"width:100px; float:center\"> </p>\n<p>So, why is retention higher when the gate is positioned earlier? One could expect the opposite: The later the obstacle, the longer people are going to engage with the game. But this is not what the data tells us. The theory of <em>hedonic adaptation</em> can give one explanation for this. In short, hedonic adaptation is the tendency for people to get less and less enjoyment out of a fun activity over time if that activity is undertaken continuously. By forcing players to take a break when they reach a gate, their enjoyment of the game is prolonged. But when the gate is moved to level 40, fewer players make it far enough, and they are more likely to quit the game because they simply got bored of it. </p>","metadata":{"tags":["context"],"editable":false,"deletable":false,"dc":{"key":"75"},"run_control":{"frozen":true}}},{"outputs":[],"execution_count":0,"cell_type":"code","source":"# So, given the data and the bootstrap analysis\n# Should we move the gate from level 30 to level 40 ?\nmove_to_level_40 = ... # True or False ?","metadata":{"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"75"}}}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.5.2","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3"},"kernelspec":{"language":"python","name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"}}}
